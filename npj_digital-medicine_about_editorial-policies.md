# Authorship

Authorship provides credit for a researcher's contributions to a study and carries accountability. Authors are expected to fulfil the criteria below (adapted from McNutt et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Feb 2018, 201715374; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1715374115; licensed under CC BY 4.0):

Each author is expected to have made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data; or the creation of new software used in the work; or have drafted the work or substantively revised it AND to have approved the submitted version (and any substantially modified version that involves the author's contribution to the study); AND to have agreed both to be personally accountable for the author's own contributions and to ensure that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work, even ones in which the author was not personally involved, are appropriately investigated, resolved, and the resolution documented in the literature.

Nature Portfolio journals encourage collaboration with colleagues in the locations where the research is conducted, and expect their inclusion as co-authors when they fulfil all authorship criteria described above. Contributors who do not meet all criteria for authorship should be listed in the Acknowledgements section.

Nature Portfolio journals reserve the right not to consider non-primary research manuscripts that have been authored by medical writers. Writing assistance should be acknowledged in all article types.

Nature Portfolio journals do not require all authors of a research paper to sign the letter of submission, nor do they impose an order on the list of authors. Submission to a Nature Portfolio journal is taken by the journal to mean that all the listed authors have agreed all of the contents, including the author list and author contribution statements. The corresponding author is responsible for having ensured that this agreement has been reached that all authors have agreed to be so listed, and have approved the manuscript submission to the journal, and for managing all communication between the journal and all co-authors, before and after publication.

The corresponding author is also responsible for submitting a competing interests' statement on behalf of all authors of the paper. It is expected that the corresponding author (and on multi-group collaborations, at least one member of each collaborating group, usually the most senior member of each submitting group or team, who accepts responsibility for the contributions to the manuscript from that team) will be responsible for the following with respect to data, code and materials:

- ensuring that data, materials, and code comply with transparency and reproducibility standards of the field and journal
- ensuring that original data/materials/code upon which the submission is based are preserved following best practices in the field so that they are retrievable for reanalysis
- confirming that data/materials/code presentation accurately reflects the original
- foreseeing and minimizing obstacles to the sharing of data/materials/code described in the work
- ensuring that all authors (or group leaders in multi-lab collaborations) have certified the author list and author contributions

At submission, the corresponding author must include written permission from the authors of the work concerned for mention of any unpublished material cited in the manuscript. The corresponding author also must clearly identify at submission any material within the manuscript that has been published previously elsewhere and provide written permission from authors of the prior work and/or publishers, as appropriate, for the re-use of such material.

After acceptance, the corresponding author is responsible for the accuracy of all content in the proof, including the names of co-authors, addresses and affiliations.

After publication, the corresponding author is the point of contact for queries about the published paper. It is their responsibility to inform all co-authors of any matters arising in relation to the published paper and to ensure such matters are dealt with promptly. Authors of published material have a responsibility to inform the journal immediately if they become aware of any aspects that requires correction.

Any changes to the author list after submission, such as a change in the order of the authors or the deletion or addition of authors, must be approved by every author. Changes of authorship by adding or deleting authors, and/or changes in Corresponding Author, and/or changes in the sequence of authors are not permitted after acceptance of a manuscript.

Nature Portfolio journal editors are not in a position to investigate or adjudicate authorship disputes before or after publication. Such disagreements, if they cannot be resolved amongst authors, should be directed to the relevant institutional authority.

The primary affiliation for each author should be the institution where the majority of their work was done. If an author has subsequently moved, the current address may also be stated. Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.

Author names are listed in Roman alphabet characters as standard. Nature Portfolio journals can support presentation of author names using non-Roman characters in parentheses after the Roman-character spelling.

## Authorship: inclusion & ethics in global research

Nature Portfolio journals encourage collaboration with colleagues in the locations where the research is conducted, and expect their inclusion as co-authors when they fulfill all authorship criteria described above. Contributors who do not meet all criteria for authorship should be listed in the Acknowledgements section.

We urge researchers to carefully consider researcher contributions and authorship criteria when involved in multi-region collaborations involving local researchers so as to promote greater equity in research collaborations. We encourage researchers to follow the recommendations set out in the Global Code of Conduct for Research in Resource-Poor Settings when designing, executing and reporting their research.

## Consortia authorship

A collective of authors can be listed as a consortium. If necessary, individual authors can be listed in both the main author list and as a member of a consortium. All authors within a consortium must be listed at the end of the paper. If it is necessary to include a list of consortium members that did not directly contribute to the paper, this list can be placed in the Supplementary Information.

## Author contribution statements

Nature Portfolio journals encourage transparency by publishing author contribution statements. Authors are required to include a statement of responsibility in the manuscript, including review-type articles, that specifies the contribution of every author. Author contribution statements are included in the published paper.

Nature Portfolio journals also allow one set of co-authors to be specified as having contributed equally to the work and one set of co-authors to be specified as having jointly supervised the work. Other equal contributions are best described in author contribution statements.

## Author identification

As part of our efforts to improve transparency and unambiguous attribution of scholarly contributions, corresponding authors of published papers must provide their Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier (ORCID) iD; co-authors are encouraged to provide ORCiD iDs.

## Author name change

An author who has changed their name for reasons such as gender transition or religious conversion may request for their name, pronouns and other relevant biographical information to be corrected on papers published prior to the change. The author can choose for this correction to happen silently, in which case there will be no note flagging the change on either the pdf or the html of the paper, or alternatively they may do so by a formal public Author Correction.

# Competing interests

In the interests of transparency and to help readers form their own judgements of potential bias, Nature Portfolio journals require authors to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described. The corresponding author is responsible for submitting a competing interests statement on behalf of all authors of the paper.

## Definition

For the purposes of this policy, competing interests are defined as financial and non-financial interests that could directly undermine, or be perceived to undermine the objectivity, integrity and value of a publication, through a potential influence on the judgements and actions of authors with regard to objective data presentation, analysis and interpretation.

Financial competing interests include any of the following:

**Funding:** Research support (including salaries, equipment, supplies, and other expenses) by organizations that may gain or lose financially through this publication. A specific role for the funder in the conceptualization, design, data collection, analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript, should be disclosed.

**Employment:** Recent (while engaged in the research project), present or anticipated employment by any organization that may gain or lose financially through this publication.

**Personal financial interests:** Stocks or shares in companies that may gain or lose financially through publication; consultation fees or other forms of remuneration from organizations that may gain or lose financially; patents or patent applications filed by the authors or their institutions whose value may be affected by publication.

Non-financial competing interests can take different forms, including personal or professional relations with organizations and individuals. Examples include unpaid membership in a government or non-governmental organization, unpaid membership in an advocacy or lobbying organization, unpaid advisory position in a commercial organization, writing or consulting for an educational company, and acting as an expert witness.

## Application to authors

Authors must disclose and specify any competing interest during the submission process, via declarations in the manuscript submission system. The corresponding author is responsible for providing a declaration on behalf of all authors.

For peer reviewed contributions, authors' declarations are disclosed to peer reviewers in full. However, if authors have opted for double-anonymized peer review, during the peer review process reviewers will be provided with a minimal statement disclosing the existence of any financial or non-financial interest, to prevent the disclosure of authors' identities.

All authors regardless of peer review model are required to include a statement at the end of their published article to declare whether or not they have any competing interests.

## Application to referees

The Nature Portfolio journals invite peer-reviewers to exclude themselves in cases where there is a significant conflict of interest, financial or otherwise. However, just as financial interests need not invalidate the conclusions of an article, nor do they automatically disqualify an individual from evaluating it. We ask peer-reviewers to inform the editors of any related interests that might be perceived as relevant.

## Application to editors

All Nature Portfolio journal editorial staff are required to declare to their employer any interests — financial or otherwise — that might influence, or be perceived to influence, their editorial practices.

## Application to external editors, guest editors and editorial board members

Editorial Board Members, Guest Editors and Editors are required to declare any competing interests and may be excluded from the peer review process if a competing interest exists. In addition, they should exclude themselves from handling manuscripts in cases where there is a competing interest. Where an Editor, Guest Editor or Editorial Board Member is on the author list they must declare this in the competing interests section on the submitted manuscript.

---

# Confidentiality

Editors, authors and reviewers are required to keep confidential all details of the editorial and peer review process on submitted manuscripts. Unless otherwise declared as a part of open peer review, the peer review process is confidential and conducted anonymously; identities of reviewers are not released.

Reviewers must maintain confidentiality of manuscripts. If a reviewer wishes to seek advice from colleagues while assessing a manuscript, the reviewer must consult with the editor and should ensure that confidentiality is maintained and that the names of any such colleagues are provided to the journal with the final report.

Regardless of whether a submitted manuscript is eventually published, correspondence with the journal, referees' reports and other confidential material must not be published, disclosed or otherwise publicised without prior written consent.

Reviewers should be aware that it is our policy to keep their names confidential and that we do our utmost to ensure this confidentiality. We cannot, however, guarantee to maintain this confidentiality in the face of a successful legal action to disclose identity.

Nature Portfolio reserves the right to contact funders, regulatory bodies, journals and the authors' institutions in cases of suspected research or publishing misconduct.

# Plagiarism and duplicate publication

## Plagiarism and fabrication

Plagiarism is unacknowledged copying or an attempt to misattribute original authorship, whether of ideas, text or results. Plagiarism can include theft or misappropriation of intellectual property and the substantial unattributed textual copying of another's work. Plagiarism can be said to have clearly occurred when large chunks of text have been cut-and-pasted without appropriate and unambiguous attribution. Such manuscripts would not be considered for publication in a Nature Portfolio journal.

Aside from wholesale verbatim reuse of text, due care must be taken to ensure appropriate attribution and citation when paraphrasing and summarising the work of others. "Text recycling" or reuse of parts of text from an author's previous research publication is a form of self-plagiarism. When reusing text, whether from the author's own publication or that of others, appropriate attribution and citation is necessary to avoid creating a misleading perception of unique contribution for the reader.

Duplicate (or redundant) publication occurs when an author reuses substantial parts of their own published work without providing the appropriate references. This can range from publishing an identical paper in multiple journals, to only adding a small amount of new data to a previously published paper.

When plagiarism becomes evident post-publication, we may correct, retract or otherwise amend the original publication depending on the degree of plagiarism, context within the published article and its impact on the overall integrity of the published study. Nature Portfolio is part of Similarity Check, a service that uses software tools to screen submitted manuscripts for text overlap.

## Due credit for others' work

**Discussion of unpublished work:** Manuscripts are sent out for review on the condition that any unpublished data cited within are properly credited and the appropriate permission has been attained. Where licenced data are cited, authors must include at submission a written assurance that they are complying with originators' data-licencing agreements.

**Discussion of published work:** When discussing the published work of others, authors must properly describe the contribution of the earlier work. Both intellectual contributions and technical developments must be acknowledged as such and appropriately cited.

## Nature Portfolio journals' policy on duplicate publication

Material submitted to a Nature Portfolio journal must be original and not published or concurrently submitted for publication elsewhere. Authors submitting a contribution to a Nature Portfolio journal who have related material under consideration or in press elsewhere should upload a clearly marked copy at the time of submission, and draw the editors' attention to it in their cover letter.

If part of a contribution that an author wishes to submit to a Nature Portfolio journal has appeared or will appear elsewhere, the author must specify the details in the covering letter accompanying the Nature Portfolio submission. Consideration by the Nature Portfolio journal is possible if the main result, conclusion, or implications are not apparent from the other work, or if there are other factors, for example if the other work is published in a language other than English.

Nature Portfolio will consider submissions containing material that has previously formed part of a PhD or other academic thesis which has been published according to the requirements of the institution awarding the qualification.

The Nature Portfolio journals support prior publication on recognized community preprint servers for review by other scientists in the field before formal submission to a journal.

Nature Portfolio journals allow publication of meeting abstracts before the full contribution is submitted. Such abstracts should be included with the Nature Portfolio journal submission and referred to in the cover letter accompanying the manuscript.

If an author of a submission is re-using a figure or figures published elsewhere, or that is copyrighted, the author must provide documentation that the previous publisher or copyright holder has given permission for the figure to be re-published.

# Image integrity and standards

Digital images submitted with a manuscript for review should be minimally processed. A certain degree of image processing is acceptable for publication (and for some experiments, fields and techniques is unavoidable), but the final image must correctly represent the original data and conform to community standards.

Editors may use software to screen images for manipulation. Editors may request the unprocessed data files to help in manuscript evaluation during the peer review process; if these data are unavailable upon request, we may need to halt the peer review process until the issues are satisfactorily resolved.

We recommend retaining unprocessed data and metadata files after publication, ideally archiving data in perpetuity. All life science papers published in Nature Portfolio journals require submission of unprocessed original images of gels and western blots to be submitted with the final accepted version.

The guidelines below are intended to help in accurate presentation of image data:

- All image acquisition tools and image processing software packages used should be listed and key image-gathering settings and processing manipulations documented in the Methods
- Images gathered at different times or from different locations should not be combined into a single image, unless it is stated that the resultant image is a product of time-averaged data or a time-lapse sequence
- If juxtaposing images is essential, the borders should be clearly demarcated in the figure and described in the legend
- The use of touch-up tools, such as cloning and healing tools in Photoshop, or any feature that deliberately obscures manipulations, is unacceptable
- Processing (such as changing brightness and contrast) is appropriate only when it is applied equally across the entire image and is applied equally to controls
- Contrast should not be adjusted so that data disappear
- Excessive manipulations, such as processing to emphasize one region in the image at the expense of others, is inappropriate

## Electrophoretic gels and blots

Quantitative comparisons between samples on different gels/blots are strongly discouraged; if this is unavoidable, the figure legend must state that the samples derive from the same experiment or parallel experiments and that gels/blots were processed in parallel. Re-arranged lanes that are non-adjacent in the gel must be clearly indicated in a manner that delineates the boundary between the lanes. Loading controls must be run on the same blot. Cropped gels in the paper must retain all important bands.

## Microscopy

Adjustments should be applied to the entire image. Threshold manipulation, expansion or contraction of signal ranges and the altering of high signals should be avoided. If "pseudo-colouring" and nonlinear adjustment are used, this must be disclosed. Adjustments of individual colour channels are sometimes necessary on "merged" images, but this should be noted in the figure legend.

In the Methods, specify the type of equipment (microscopes/objective lenses, cameras, detectors, filter model and batch number) and acquisition software used. Processing software should be named in the methods section and any manipulations indicated in the relevant figure legends.

# Preprints & Conference Proceedings

## Preprints

Nature Portfolio journals encourage posting of preprints of primary research manuscripts on preprint servers of the authors' choice, authors' or institutional websites, and open communications between researchers whether on community preprint servers or preprint commenting platforms.

Preprints are defined as an author's version of a research manuscript prior to formal peer review at a journal, which is deposited on a public server; preprints may be posted at any time during the peer review process. Posting of preprints is not considered prior publication and will not jeopardize consideration at Nature Portfolio journals. Manuscripts posted on preprint servers will not be taken into account when determining the advance provided by a study under consideration at a Nature Portfolio journal.

Authors should disclose details of preprint posting, including DOI and licensing terms, upon submission of the manuscript or at any other point during consideration at a Nature Portfolio journal. Once the preprint is published, it is the author's responsibility to ensure that the preprint record is updated with a publication reference, including the DOI and a URL link to the published version of the article on the journal website.

Authors may choose any license of their choice for the preprint including Creative Commons licenses.

Preprints may be cited in the reference list of articles under consideration at Nature Portfolio journals.

Authors posting preprints are asked to respect our policy on communications with the media. Researchers may respond to requests from the media in response to a preprint or conference presentation by providing explanation or clarification of the work, or information about its context. We advise that researchers approached by reporters in response to a preprint make it clear that the paper has not yet undergone peer review, that the findings are provisional and that the conclusions may change.

## Conference proceedings

Publishing work in conference proceedings is common in some research communities. The Nature journals are happy to consider submissions containing material that has been published in a conference proceedings paper. However, the submission should provide a substantial extension of results, methodology, analysis, conclusions and/or implications over the conference proceedings paper; the final decision on what constitutes a substantial extension is made by the editors at each individual journal.

Authors must provide details of the conference proceedings paper with their submission including relevant citation in the submitted manuscript. Authors must obtain all necessary permissions to re-use previously published material and attribute appropriately.

# Peer Review

## General information

The following types of contribution to Nature Portfolio journals are peer-reviewed: Articles, Letters, Brief Communications, Matters Arising, Technical Reports, Analysis, Resources, Reviews, Perspectives and Insight articles. Correspondence and all forms of published correction may also be peer-reviewed at the discretion of the editors.

## Online manuscript review

We ask peer-reviewers to submit their reports via our secure online system by following the link provided in the editor's email.

## Criteria for publication

In general, to be acceptable, a paper should represent an advance in understanding likely to influence thinking in the field, with strong evidence for their conclusions. There should be a discernible reason why the work deserves the visibility of publication in a Nature Portfolio journal rather than the best of the specialist journals.

## The review process

All submitted manuscripts are read by the editorial staff. Only those papers that seem most likely to meet our editorial criteria are sent for formal review. Those papers judged by the editors to be of insufficient general interest or otherwise inappropriate are rejected promptly without external review.

Manuscripts judged to be of potential interest to our readership are sent for formal review, typically to two or three reviewers. The editors then make a decision based on the reviewers' advice: Accept, Invite revision, Reject but indicate resubmission possible, or Reject outright.

Editorial decisions are not a matter of counting votes or numerical rank assessments, and we do not always follow the majority recommendation. We try to evaluate the strength of the arguments raised by each reviewer and by the authors.

## Selecting peer-reviewers

Reviewer selection is critical to the publication process, and we base our choice on many factors, including expertise, reputation, specific recommendations and our own previous experience of a reviewer's characteristics. Springer Nature is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion; Nature Portfolio journals strive for diverse demographic representation of peer reviewers.

## Writing the review

The primary purpose of the review is to provide the editors with the information needed to reach a decision but the review should also instruct the authors on how they can strengthen their paper. Referees should provide assessments of key results, validity, originality and significance, data and methodology, appropriate use of statistics, conclusions, suggested improvements, references, and clarity.

## AI use by peer reviewers

Peer reviewers are asked not to upload manuscripts into generative AI tools. If any part of the evaluation was supported by an AI tool, reviewers must declare the use transparently in the peer review report.

## Timing

Nature Portfolio journals are committed to rapid editorial decisions and publication. We ask reviewers to respond promptly within the number of days agreed.

## Anonymity

We do not release referees' identities to authors or to other reviewers unless a referee voluntarily signs their comments. To increase transparency, reviewers may sign their reports if they feel comfortable doing so.

## Double anonymized peer review

Some Nature-branded journals and Communications journals offer a double-anonymized peer review option. Authors who choose this option remain anonymous to the referees throughout the consideration process.

## Transparent peer review

Several Nature journals follow a transparent peer review system, publishing details about the peer review process as part of the publication including reviewer comments, author rebuttal letters, and editorial decision letters.

## Editing referees' reports

As a matter of policy, we do not suppress reviewers' reports; any comments intended for the authors are transmitted. On rare occasions, we may edit a report to remove offensive language or comments that reveal confidential information.

## Ethics and security

Nature Portfolio journal editors may seek advice about submitted papers not only from technical reviewers but also on any aspect of a paper that raises concerns, including ethical issues or issues of data or materials access.

---

# Reporting standards and availability of data, materials, code and protocols

An inherent principle of publication is that others should be able to replicate and build upon the authors' published claims. A condition of publication in a Nature Portfolio journal is that authors are required to make materials, data, code, and associated protocols promptly available to readers without undue qualifications.

Any restrictions on the availability of materials or information must be disclosed to the editors at the time of submission. Any restrictions must also be disclosed in the submitted manuscript.

## Reporting requirements

Nature Portfolio journals aim to improve the transparency of reporting and reproducibility of published results across all areas of science. Where relevant, manuscripts sent for review must include completed reporting summary documents.

Authors of research articles in the life sciences, behavioural & social sciences and ecology, evolution & environmental sciences are required to provide details about elements of experimental and analytical design in a reporting summary that will be published with all accepted manuscripts.

## Availability of data

All published manuscripts reporting original research in Nature Portfolio journals must include a data availability statement. The data availability statement must make the conditions of access to the minimum dataset that are necessary to interpret, verify and extend the research in the article, transparent to readers.

This minimum dataset may be provided through deposition in public community/discipline-specific repositories, custom proprietary repositories for certain types of datasets, or general repositories like Figshare, Zenodo and Dryad.

Supporting data must be made available to editors and peer reviewers where requested at the time of submission for the purposes of evaluating the manuscript.

Mandatory deposition of data is required for certain data types including protein sequences, DNA and RNA sequences, genetic polymorphisms, macromolecular structure, gene expression data, crystallographic data for small molecules, and proteomics data.

## Availability of materials

A condition of publication in a Nature Portfolio journal is that authors are required to make unique materials promptly available to others without undue qualifications. It is acceptable to request reasonable payment to cover costs of distribution and reagents may be made available via commercial or non-commercial third party providers.

Any restrictions on materials availability, including if materials are to be distributed by a for-profit company, must be clearly stated in the paper.

## Availability and peer review of computer code and algorithm

Authors must make available upon request, to editors and reviewers, any previously unreported custom computer code or algorithm used to generate results that are reported in the paper and central to its main claims.

For all studies using custom code or mathematical algorithm that is deemed central to the conclusions, a statement must be included under the heading "Code availability", indicating whether and how the code or algorithm can be accessed, including any restrictions to access.

Upon publication, Nature Portfolio journals consider it best practice to release custom computer code in a way that allows readers to repeat the published results. Code should be deposited in a DOI-minting repository such as Zenodo or Code Ocean and cited in the reference list.

## Experimental protocols

Nature Portfolio journals encourage authors to share their step-by-step experimental protocols on a protocol sharing platform of their choice. Where such protocols are available, please provide a DOI or other citation details in the paper.

## Pre-registration

Nature Portfolio journals support study pre-registration (including clinical trials) and pre-registration of analysis plans in public repositories; details of pre-registration should be provided with submission.

## Replication studies

Nature Portfolio appreciates the value of replication of previous findings. We welcome submission of replication studies that provide new insights into previously published results and will evaluate these submissions with the same editorial standards we apply to other submissions.

## Clinical Trials

Authors reporting phase II and phase III randomized controlled trials must refer to the CONSORT Statement for recommendations to facilitate the complete and transparent reporting of trial findings.

Prospective clinical trials must be registered before the start of patient enrollment in www.clinicaltrials.gov or a similar public repository that matches the criteria established by ICMJE. The trial registration number must be reported in the paper.

# Corrections, Retractions and Matters Arising

## Corrections & Retractions

The Nature Portfolio journals will issue corrections, retraction statements and other post-publication updates including Editor's Notes and Editorial Expressions of Concern on published content.

**Author Correction:** An Author Correction may be published to correct an important error(s) made by the author(s) that affects the scientific integrity of the published article, the publication record, or the reputation of the authors or the journal.

**Author Name Change:** For authors who've changed their name and wish to correct it on their published works, please contact Springer Nature Support.

**Publisher Correction:** A Publisher Correction may be published to correct an important error(s) made by the journal that affects the scientific integrity of the published article, the publication record, or the reputation of the authors or of the journal.

**Addendum:** An addendum is generally published when significant additional information crucial to the reader's understanding of the article has come to light following publication of the article.

**Editor's Note:** An Editor's Note is a notification alerting readers if the journal has initiated an inquiry in response to concerns raised about a published article.

**Editorial Expression of Concern:** An Editorial Expression of Concern is a statement from the editors alerting readers to serious concerns affecting the integrity of the published paper.

**Retraction:** An article may be retracted when the integrity of the published work is substantially undermined owing to errors in the conduct, analysis and/or reporting of the study. Violation of publication or research ethics may also result in a study's retraction.

## Removal of published content

In exceptional circumstances, Springer Nature reserves the right to remove an article, chapter, book or other content from Springer Nature's online platforms. Such action may be taken when content is defamatory, infringes a third party's rights, or is otherwise unlawful; a court or government order has been issued; or content would pose an immediate and serious risk to health.

## Matters Arising

Nature Portfolio journals recognize the importance of post-publication commentary on published research as necessary to advancing scientific discourse. Formal post-publication commentary on published papers can involve challenges, clarifications or, in some cases, replication of the published work, and after peer review may be published online as Matters Arising, usually alongside a Reply from the original Nature journal authors.

## Addressing post-publication issues

We are committed to maintaining the integrity of the scientific record and thoroughly investigate concerns that are directly raised with us by authors and readers. Authors are always given an opportunity to respond to the concerns raised.

Depending on the seriousness of the issues, the following outcomes may ensue: If the manuscript is still under consideration, it may be rejected and returned to the author. If the article has already been published online, a correction, Addendum, Editor's Note, Editorial Expression of Concern, or retraction may be issued.

# Research Ethics

## Principles of scholarly freedom and scholarly responsibility

Researchers should be free to pursue lines of inquiry and the communication of knowledge and ideas without fear of repression or censorship. At the same time, they have the ethical obligation to uphold intellectual integrity and avoid preventable harms that may arise in the course of research or its communication.

## Benefits and harms of research

Research should respect the dignity and rights of human research participants; of individuals or groups connected either with the research participants or the research topic; and of the communities in which research is carried out. Research should also respect the rights of non-human life, tangible and intangible heritage, natural resources, and the environment.

Consideration of risks and benefits underlies the editorial process of all forms of scholarly communication in our publications. Editors consider harms that might result from the publication and may decline publication in cases of substantial risk of harm that outweighs any potential benefits.

## Animal research

For primary research manuscripts reporting experiments on live vertebrates and/or higher invertebrates, the corresponding author must confirm that all experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The manuscript must include a statement identifying the institutional and/or licensing committee approving the experiments.

We recommend following the ARRIVE 2.0 reporting guidelines when documenting animal studies.

## Research with human participants, their data or biological material

Research involving human research participants must have been performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Authors must identify the ethics committee approving the research, including the name and reference number of the committee in submitted manuscripts.

Manuscripts must also include a statement affirming that informed consent was obtained from all human research participants.

## Research on human populations (including reporting standards)

For studies involving humans categorized by race, ethnicity, national or social origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political or other beliefs, age, disease, disability, socio-economic status, or other socially constructed groupings, authors should explicitly describe their methods of categorization, define categories, justify their choices, and explain how they controlled for confounding variables.

We require that all content submitted for publication be respectful of the dignity and rights of individuals and human groups.

## Race, ethnicity and racism

Race and ethnicity are sociopolitical constructs. Humans do not have biological races based on modern biological criteria. Studies that use the constructs of race and/or ethnicity should explicitly motivate their use. Race/ethnicity should not be used as proxies for other variables.

Racism is scientifically unfounded and ethically untenable.

## Sex, gender (identity/presentation), and sexual orientation

Researchers are encouraged to follow the Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines. Authors should use the terms sex (biological attribute) and gender (shaped by social and cultural circumstances) carefully.

Sexist, misogynistic and/or anti-LGBTQ+ content is ethically objectionable.

## Studies involving vulnerable groups

For manuscripts reporting studies involving vulnerable groups where there is the potential for coercion or where consent may not have been fully informed, extra care will be taken by the editor.

## Clinical trials

All interventional trials must be registered before enrollment of the first participant. Authors reporting phase II and phase III randomized controlled trials should refer to the CONSORT Statement.

## Studies involving human embryos, gametes and stem cells

Manuscripts must include confirmation that all experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The manuscript must include an ethics statement and confirm that informed consent was obtained from all recipients and/or donors of cells or tissues.

## Dual use research of concern

Some manuscripts provide information that could be directly misapplied to pose a significant threat to public health, safety or security. For such information to be published, the benefit must outweigh any risks. We reserve the right to take expert advice in cases where concerns may arise.

---

# Press and embargo policies

## Communication with the media

We strongly discourage authors and potential authors from direct solicitation of media coverage of material they have submitted to Nature and the Nature Portfolio journals. Accepted contributions can be discussed with the media only once the publication date has been confirmed and no more than a week before the publication date under our embargo conditions.

We produce and distribute press releases summarizing upcoming content to a list of registered journalists. Journalists are encouraged to read the full version of any papers they wish to cover, and are given the names and contact details of corresponding authors. The content of the press release and papers is embargoed until the time and date clearly stated on the press release.

Authors whose papers are scheduled for publication may also arrange their own publicity, but they must strictly adhere to our media embargo and are advised to coordinate their own publicity with our press office.

The Nature Portfolio journals believe that their media embargo serves scientists, authors, journalists and the public. Our policy is to release information about our content in a way that provides fair and equal access to the media, allowing it to provide informed comment based on the complete and final version of the paper that is to be published.

Journalists who break our embargoes have been removed from the press-release circulation list, and we shall continue to use this sanction when appropriate.

## Communication between scientists

Nature Portfolio journals do not wish to hinder communication among researchers. We support open communications between researchers whether on a recognised community preprint server or preprint commenting platforms, through discussions at research meetings or online collaborative sites such as wikis or the author's blog.

Neither conference presentations nor posting on recognized preprint servers constitute prior publication.

Researchers may respond to requests from the media in response to a preprint or conference presentation, by providing explanation or clarification of the work, or information about its context. In these circumstances, media coverage will not hinder editorial handling of the submission.

We advise that researchers approached by reporters in response to a preprint make it clear that the paper has not yet undergone peer review, that the findings are provisional and that the conclusions may change.

Authors are expected to keep the details of the peer review and editorial process confidential.

# Self archiving and license to publish

Publishing licences and compliance with open access mandates.

## Nature Portfolio author licence policy

This policy applies to all journals published by Nature Portfolio, including Nature and the journals with "Nature" in their titles. Nature Portfolio's policies are compatible with the vast majority of funders' open access and self-archiving policies.

Nature Portfolio does not require authors of original (primary) research papers to assign the copyright of their published contributions. Authors grant Nature Portfolio an exclusive licence to publish, in return for which they can reuse their papers in their future printed work without first requiring permission from the publisher of the journal.

For non-primary articles (including articles such as Reviews, Perspectives, Comments, News & Views), copyright is retained by Springer Nature.

## Creative commons licences

Open access articles in npj Digital Medicine are published under a CC BY-NC-ND (Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives 4.0 International licence) or CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence) licence.

**CC BY-NC-ND:** The article can be shared for non-commercial purposes as long as the authors are credited. Permission is needed for commercial re-use or sharing adapted and derivative versions.

**CC BY:** The article may be shared and adapted for any purpose, including commercially, so long as the authors are credited.

Authors are advised to check their funder's open access requirements, to ensure compliance.

## Self-archiving policy

**Preprints:** Nature Portfolio journals encourage posting of preprints of primary research manuscripts on preprint servers of the authors' choice. Preprints may be posted at any time during the peer review process. Posting of preprints is not considered prior publication and will not jeopardize consideration at Nature Portfolio journals.

Authors should disclose details of preprint posting, including DOI and licensing terms, upon submission of the manuscript.

**Self-archiving of papers published via the subscription route:** When an article is accepted for publication in a Nature Portfolio journal via the subscription route, authors are permitted to self-archive the accepted manuscript on their own personal website and/or in their funder or institutional repositories, for public release six months after publication.

Authors should cite the publication reference and DOI number on the first page of any deposited version, and provide a link from it to the URL of the published article on the journal's website.

**Self-archiving of papers published open access:** For open access content published under a Creative Commons licence, authors are encouraged to deposit the published version immediately on publication, alongside a link to the URL of the published article on the journal's website.

## Springer Nature terms for use of archived accepted manuscripts

For articles archived into academic repositories where Springer Nature holds copyright or an exclusive license to publish, users may view, print, copy, download and text and data-mine the content for purposes of academic research, subject to the full conditions of use.

# Acknowledgements

The acknowledgement section can be used to thank anyone important in the publication of the work who does not qualify for authorship and to declare relevant funding information.

The acknowledgement section should not be used to list contributors who meet our criteria for authorship. We urge authors to carefully consider researcher contributions and authorship criteria when involved in multi-region collaborations involving local researchers so as to promote greater equity in research collaborations.

The section should also not be used to declare competing interests, including any related to funding sources that may gain or lose financially through this publication. These should be declared separately in a competing interest statement.

Acknowledgements should be brief, and should not include thanks to anonymous referees or editors, inessential words, or effusive comments.

When acknowledging funding, our recommended best practice is that authors should acknowledge funders and grants on publications when the activities that contributed to that publication are within scope of the acknowledged grant and arise directly from a specific grant.

The following questions can be used to determine if the activities arise from a specific grant:

- Are the results included in the publication original and the direct result of experimentation, materials or analysis supported by the grant?
- Does the grant financially support publication of the manuscript?

If the answer is yes to any of these questions, best practice is to acknowledge the funding source and grant number, if the grant requires it.

Please ensure that relevant funding sources are disclosed for all authors. Authors should also ensure they are aware of any specific acknowledgement requirements from their funders.

# Appeals & Complaints

## Appeals

If you wish to ask for the rejection of a manuscript to be reconsidered, you should, in the first instance, contact the Handling Editor through the instructions on the journal's website. Priority is given to active submissions under consideration, therefore, decisions on appeals may take longer.

Final decisions on appeals will rest with the editorial team. Authors who wish to appeal an editorial decision should check the journal website for directions on how to submit an appeal.

If appeals are successful, authors will be given information about how their manuscript will be further handled.

## Complaints

The below procedure applies to complaints about the failure of processes, such as long delays in handling papers, and complaints about publication ethics, such as author misconduct. To make a complaint about an editorial decision to reject a manuscript, please see the above policy on appeal against a rejection.

Complaints about the failure of processes should, in the first instance, be handled by the Chief Editor/Editor-in-Chief responsible for the journal and/or the Editor who handled the paper.

**Complaints about processes, e.g. time taken to review:** The Chief Editor/Editor-in-Chief together with the Handling Editor and/or a member of the journal staff will investigate the matter. The complainant will be given appropriate feedback. Feedback is provided to relevant stakeholders to improve processes and procedures.

**Complaints about publication ethics, e.g., researcher, author, editor, or reviewer conduct:** The Chief Editor/Editor-in-Chief or Handling Editor will follow guidelines published by the Committee on Publication Ethics. External Editors-in-Chief or Handling Editors will reach out to their in-house contact for advice on difficult or complicated cases.

If the conduct of the Chief Editor/Editor-in-Chief is the subject of the complaint, please contact the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group by email.

If the complainant remains dissatisfied with the handling of their complaint, it will be escalated to the journal's editorial management team for investigation.

# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Springer Nature is monitoring ongoing developments in this area closely and will review (and update) these policies as appropriate.

## AI authorship

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, do not currently satisfy our authorship criteria. Notably an attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work, which cannot be effectively applied to LLMs.

Use of an LLM should be properly documented in the Methods section (and if a Methods section is not available, in a suitable alternative part) of the manuscript.

The use of an LLM (or other AI-tool) for "AI assisted copy editing" purposes does not need to be declared. In this context, we define the term "AI assisted copy editing" as AI-assisted improvements to human-generated texts for readability and style, and to ensure that the texts are free of errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation and tone. In all cases, there must be human accountability for the final version of the text and agreement from the authors that the edits reflect their original work.

## Generative AI images

While legal issues relating to AI-generated images and videos remain broadly unresolved, Springer Nature journals are unable to permit its use for publication.

Exceptions:
- Images/art obtained from agencies that we have contractual relationships with that have created images in a legally acceptable manner
- Images and videos that are directly referenced in a piece that is specifically about AI and such cases will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis
- The use of generative AI tools developed with specific sets of underlying scientific data that can be attributed, checked and verified for accuracy, provided that ethics, copyright and terms of use restrictions are adhered to

All exceptions must be labelled clearly as generated by AI within the image field.

The use of non-generative machine learning tools to manipulate, combine or enhance existing images or figures should be disclosed in the relevant caption upon submission.

## AI use by peer reviewers

Peer reviewers play a vital role in scientific publishing. Their expert evaluations and recommendations guide editors in their decisions and ensure that published research is valid, rigorous, and credible.

Despite rapid progress, generative AI tools have considerable limitations: they can lack up-to-date knowledge and may produce nonsensical, biased or false information. Manuscripts may also include sensitive or proprietary information that should not be shared outside the peer review process.

For these reasons, peer reviewers should not upload manuscripts into generative AI tools. If any part of the evaluation was supported by an AI tool, peer reviewers must declare the use transparently in the peer review report.

## Editorial use

Nature Portfolio journals occasionally use internal Springer Nature-developed artificial intelligence tools to support the generation of accessory content, such as summary points. These are always edited and fact-checked by the author and/or editor to meet Nature Portfolio publication standards. Any substantive use of artificial intelligence beyond accessory content will be declared on an individual article basis.

# Collections, Guest Edited Collections, and Special Issues

Collections, Guest Edited Collections, and Special Issues may include original primary research Articles, Reviews, and other content types published by the journal.

All manuscripts submitted to Nature Portfolio Journal Collections, Guest Edited Collections, or Special Issues are assessed according to the journal's standard editorial criteria and are subject to all of the Nature Portfolio standard Editorial Policies, including the Competing Interests policy.

The content of the submission will also be assessed to ensure it lies within the scope of the Collection, Guest Edited Collection, or Special Issue.

All submissions that meet the journal's criteria for peer review will undergo the journal's standard peer review process. Please visit the journal's website for information on the review process used.

The peer review of any submissions for which the Editors of the Collection, Guest Edited Collection, or Special Issue, have competing interests is handled by another Editor, who has no competing interests, to ensure the evaluation of these submissions is objective.

Nature Portfolio in-house editors reserve the right to assume responsibility for the management of a Collection, Guest Edited Collection, or Special Issue at any stage.
