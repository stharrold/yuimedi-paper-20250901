- **2025-10-17 to 2025-10-30**: Paper 2 algorithm implementation  
- **2025-11-28 to 2025-12-11**: Paper 2 statistical analysis
- **2026-01-16 to 2026-01-29**: Paper 3 implementation
- **2026-01-30 to 2026-02-12**: Paper 3 query translation

Total PTO needed: 10 days across 30 weeks

### SME Review Budget

**Required Subject Matter Experts:**
1. **Healthcare IT/EMR Systems Expert** (Paper 1)
   - Focus: Validate healthcare data infrastructure challenges and institutional knowledge gaps
   - Review scope: Confirm problem significance, verify market sizing
   - Typical rate: $90-150/hour ([Salary.com SME rates](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/recruiting/subject-matter-expert-hourly-wages))
   
2. **Data Science/AI Healthcare Expert** (Paper 2)  
   - Focus: Validate machine learning approach on degraded healthcare data
   - Review scope: Verify algorithm accuracy, assess technical soundness
   - Typical rate: $120-180/hour ([PayScale Technical SME](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Technical_Subject_Matter_Expert/Salary))
   
3. **FHIR/OMOP Standards Expert** (Paper 3)
   - Focus: Validate healthcare interoperability approach and schema mappings
   - Review scope: Confirm mapping accuracy, assess implementation feasibility
   - Typical rate: $100-200/hour (specialized expertise)

**Budget Estimate:**
- 6 hours review per paper × 3 papers = 18 hours total
- Average rate: $150/hour
- **Total SME budget: $2,700**

**Alternative: Academic Peer Review Model**
- Some journals offer $50-450 per review ([Science AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/450-question-should-journals-pay-peer-reviewers))
- BMC/Research Square: $50 honorarium ([BMC Medical Ethics](https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/peer-review-policy))
- Feminist Review: £130 (~$165) per review ([Feminist Review](https://femrev.wordpress.com/2022/05/24/feminist-review-peer-review-honorariums/))
- **Budget if using academic rates: $450-600 total** (3 reviews × $150-200)

**Publication & Distribution Costs:**
- Preprint servers (arXiv, medRxiv, SSRN): **$0**
- ResearchGate, Zenodo uploads: **$0**
- JMIR publication fee (if accepted): **~$3,000**
- AHIMA Journal submission: **$0** (possible page charges if accepted)
- Conference registrations (optional): **$500-1,000** per conference
- **Realistic publication budget: $0-4,000** (depending on journal selection)

Note: Samuel Harrold self-funds Claude subscription ($200/month)

### Review Checkpoints
- **2025-10-02**: Paper 1 internal review (YuiMedi team leads)
- **2025-12-18**: Paper 2 internal review (YuiMedi team leads)
- **2026-02-26**: Paper 3 internal review (YuiMedi team leads)
- **2026-03-01 to 2026-03-31**: External SME reviews (all papers)

### Risk Mitigation

**Critical Risk: DSH Single Point of Failure**
- **Risk Level: HIGH** - No backup identified for 270-330 hours
- **Impact**: Project delay/failure if DSH unavailable
- **Mitigation Required**: Assign backup developer immediately

### Buffer Time Allocation
- Paper 1: 10h buffer (Week 9)
- Paper 2: 10h buffer (Week 11)
- Paper 3: 20h buffer (Weeks 9-10)

### Contingency Plans
- **Data access delays:** Use synthetic data initially
- **Algorithm complexity:** Leverage Claude Code for rapid prototyping
- **Writing bottlenecks:** Draft sections in parallel
- **Review delays:** Schedule peer reviews early

### AI Acceleration Assumptions
Time estimates assume 50% reduction from traditional methods based on:
- Validated 99% reduction for systematic reviews ([arXiv:2504.14822](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14822))
- 79% automation rate for Claude Code ([Anthropic research](https://www.anthropic.com/research/impact-software-development))
- Conservative adjustment for academic validation requirements
- Human oversight still required for peer review and clinical accuracy

Note: Using pre-anonymized institutional data eliminates IRB timeline

Actual speedup will vary based on:
- User's AI tool proficiency
- Complexity of research domain
- Institution's acceptance of AI-assisted work
