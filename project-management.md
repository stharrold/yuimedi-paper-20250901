## Paper Objectives and Strategic Value

### Thought Leadership Goals
These academic whitepapers establish Yuimedi's intellectual authority in healthcare AI, not direct product promotion. Each paper contributes to positioning Yuimedi as the industry's go-to expert on AI-enabled healthcare data challenges.

### Paper 1: Literature and Industry Review
**Purpose:** Document the healthcare technology gap crisis
**Goals:**
- Quantify the loss of institutional knowledge due to developer turnover
- Identify root causes: lack of documentation, cross-training, career disincentives
- Establish the need for tools like YuiQuery as human interfaces for discoverable use-cases

**Key Message:** Healthcare IT suffers from a critical knowledge transfer problem that AI-enabled tools can address

**Success Metrics (Thought Leadership):**
- Industry recognition: Referenced by 5+ healthcare organizations
- Conference invitations: 2+ speaking opportunities generated
- Partnership inquiries: 3+ strategic discussions initiated
- Media coverage: Featured in healthcare IT publications

**Technical Validation:**
- Problem validated with data from 10+ healthcare institutions
- Identifies 3-5 specific pain points YuiQuery addresses
- Provides market sizing for YuiQuery's target audience

### Paper 2: Proof of Concept
**Purpose:** Demonstrate YuiQuery's capability with worst-case data scenarios
**Goals:**
- Show YuiQuery can work with healthcare datasets lacking column names and data dictionaries
- Programmatically infer primary/foreign keys and build data models
- Achieve semantic understanding of fields from value distributions

**Key Message:** Even with poor data quality standards, AI-enabled tools like YuiQuery can programmatically infer business interpretations

**Success Metrics:**
- Algorithm achieves >85% accuracy in schema inference
- Successfully processes real degraded healthcare data
- Demonstrates 50% time reduction vs manual methods

### Paper 3: Meta-level Schema Mapping Through FHIR
**Purpose:** Enable healthcare interoperability at scale
**Goals:**
- Map Paper 2's data model to FHIR entities
- Show FHIR mappings to Epic, CMS quality models, OMOP
- Store all mappings/queries in JSON-LD for reusability

**Key Message:** High-impact queries for finance and quality are achievable with minimal overhead through AI-enabled schema mappings

**Success Metrics:**
- Successfully maps to 3+ healthcare standards
- Demonstrates query portability across systems
- Shows 70%+ reduction in integration time

## Publication Strategy & Submission Portals

### Phased Release Strategy

**Phase 1: Preprint Servers (Immediate Visibility)**
- **Timeline**: 24-72 hour review
- **Primary**: medRxiv (healthcare/medical focus)
- **Secondary**: arXiv (technical/CS audience) 
- **Tertiary**: SSRN (social science/health policy angle)
- **Cost**: FREE
- **Benefits**: Establish priority, immediate DOI, citeable

**Phase 2: Professional Journals (Credibility)**
- **Timeline**: 2-8 week review
- **Options**:
  - AHIMA Journal (health information management)
  - JMIR Publications (medical informatics, ~$3,000 if accepted)
- **Benefits**: Peer review validation, indexed in PubMed

**Phase 3: Direct Distribution (Control)**
- **Timeline**: Immediate
- **Platforms**:
  - ResearchGate (academic network)
  - Zenodo (permanent DOI, CERN-backed)
  - Yuimedi website (marketing control)
- **Cost**: FREE
- **Benefits**: Full control, immediate access, network effects

### Important Clarifications

**What HIMSS/AMIA Are NOT:**
- They do NOT publish whitepapers
- They accept conference presentation proposals only
- Conference abstracts ‚â† whitepaper publication
- These are separate tracks with different purposes

**Not Accepting External Submissions:**
- McKinsey, Deloitte, Accenture (internal only)
- World Economic Forum (invitation/partnership only)
- Most consulting firms don't accept unsolicited papers

### Recommended Approach
1. Complete Paper 1 by Sept 30, 2025
2. Submit immediately to medRxiv (24-72hr publication)
3. Upload to ResearchGate same day
4. Consider JMIR submission for peer review (optional)
5. Optionally submit conference abstract to HIMSS 2026 (separate from paper)

- **Yuimedi Technical Team**: ~60 hours total for testing/reviews
- **Yuimedi Leadership Team**: ~10 hours for strategic reviews
- **Developer Samuel Harrold**: 270-330 hours (unchanged)

### PTO Strategy for Critical Weeks
Samuel Harrold may need to take 2 days PTO to double capacity (10‚Üí20 hrs) during:
- **2025-09-12 to 2025-09-25**: Paper 1 draft writing
- **2025-10-17 to 2025-10-30**: Paper 2 algorithm implementation  
- **2025-11-28 to 2025-12-11**: Paper 2 statistical analysis
- **2026-01-16 to 2026-01-29**: Paper 3 implementation
- **2026-01-30 to 2026-02-12**: Paper 3 query translation

Total PTO needed: 10 days across 30 weeks

### SME Review Budget

**Required Subject Matter Experts:**
1. **Healthcare IT/EMR Systems Expert** (Paper 1)
   - Focus: Validate healthcare data infrastructure challenges and institutional knowledge gaps
   - Review scope: Confirm problem significance, verify market sizing
   - Typical rate: $90-150/hour ([Salary.com SME rates](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/recruiting/subject-matter-expert-hourly-wages))
   
2. **Data Science/AI Healthcare Expert** (Paper 2)  
   - Focus: Validate machine learning approach on degraded healthcare data
   - Review scope: Verify algorithm accuracy, assess technical soundness
   - Typical rate: $120-180/hour ([PayScale Technical SME](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Technical_Subject_Matter_Expert/Salary))
   
3. **FHIR/OMOP Standards Expert** (Paper 3)
   - Focus: Validate healthcare interoperability approach and schema mappings
   - Review scope: Confirm mapping accuracy, assess implementation feasibility
   - Typical rate: $100-200/hour (specialized expertise)

**Budget Estimate:**
- 6 hours review per paper √ó 3 papers = 18 hours total
- Average rate: $150/hour
- **Total SME budget: $2,700**

**Alternative: Academic Peer Review Model**
- Some journals offer $50-450 per review ([Science AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/450-question-should-journals-pay-peer-reviewers))
- BMC/Research Square: $50 honorarium ([BMC Medical Ethics](https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/peer-review-policy))
- Feminist Review: ¬£130 (~$165) per review ([Feminist Review](https://femrev.wordpress.com/2022/05/24/feminist-review-peer-review-honorariums/))
- **Budget if using academic rates: $450-600 total** (3 reviews √ó $150-200)

**Publication & Distribution Costs:**
- Preprint servers (arXiv, medRxiv, SSRN): **$0**
- ResearchGate, Zenodo uploads: **$0**
- JMIR publication fee (if accepted): **~$3,000**
- AHIMA Journal submission: **$0** (possible page charges if accepted)
- Conference registrations (optional): **$500-1,000** per conference
- **Realistic publication budget: $0-4,000** (depending on journal selection)

Note: Samuel Harrold self-funds Claude subscription ($200/month)

### Review Checkpoints
- **2025-10-02**: Paper 1 internal review (YuiMedi team leads)
- **2025-12-18**: Paper 2 internal review (YuiMedi team leads)
- **2026-02-26**: Paper 3 internal review (YuiMedi team leads)
- **2026-03-01 to 2026-03-31**: External SME reviews (all papers)

### Risk Mitigation

**Critical Risk: DSH Single Point of Failure**
- **Risk Level: HIGH** - No backup identified for 270-330 hours
- **Impact**: Project delay/failure if DSH unavailable
- **Mitigation Required**: Assign backup developer immediately

### Buffer Time Allocation
- Paper 1: 10h buffer (Week 9)
- Paper 2: 10h buffer (Week 11)
- Paper 3: 20h buffer (Weeks 9-10)

### Contingency Plans
- **Data access delays:** Use synthetic data initially
- **Algorithm complexity:** Leverage Claude Code for rapid prototyping
- **Writing bottlenecks:** Draft sections in parallel
- **Review delays:** Schedule peer reviews early

### AI Acceleration Assumptions
Time estimates assume 50% reduction from traditional methods based on:
- Validated 99% reduction for systematic reviews ([arXiv:2504.14822](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14822))
- 79% automation rate for Claude Code ([Anthropic research](https://www.anthropic.com/research/impact-software-development))
- Conservative adjustment for academic validation requirements
- Human oversight still required for peer review and clinical accuracy

Note: Using pre-anonymized institutional data eliminates IRB timeline

Actual speedup will vary based on:
- User's AI tool proficiency
- Complexity of research domain
- Institution's acceptance of AI-assisted work
