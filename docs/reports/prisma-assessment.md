## 1. Executive Summary

**Decision: PRISMA 2020 full compliance is NOT required for this paper.**

PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) is designed for systematic reviews that follow pre-registered protocols with exhaustive database searches. This paper is explicitly classified as a **narrative review with original analytical framework**, not a systematic review with meta-analysis.

While full PRISMA compliance is not required and would misrepresent the methodology, this paper incorporates PRISMA-inspired transparency elements to strengthen methodological rigor. The Methodology section documents literature search sources, selection criteria, synthesis approach, and methodological limitations.

## 2. PRISMA 2020 Guidelines Overview

### 2.1 Purpose and Scope

PRISMA 2020 is the updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews of studies that evaluate health interventions. It includes:

- **27-item checklist** covering title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and other information
- **Flow diagram** documenting study identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion
- **Extensions** for specific review types (PRISMA-ScR for scoping reviews, PRISMA-P for protocols)

### 2.2 When PRISMA is Required

PRISMA is required or strongly recommended for:

- Systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis
- Scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR extension)
- Reviews registered in PROSPERO
- Submissions to journals requiring PRISMA compliance (e.g., JAMIA for systematic reviews)

### 2.3 When PRISMA is Not Required

PRISMA is not required for:

- **Narrative reviews** (this paper)
- Expert opinion pieces
- Perspectives and commentaries
- Original research articles
- Literature reviews without systematic methodology

## 3. Paper Classification Analysis

### 3.1 Current Classification

**Type:** Narrative review with original analytical framework

**Evidence supporting this classification:**

1. **paper.md (Data Availability section):** "This is a narrative review. No primary datasets were generated or analyzed."
2. **GEMINI.md (line 35):** Explicitly states "Narrative review with original analytical framework (NOT a systematic review with meta-analysis)"
3. **npj Digital Medicine Review criteria:** Target journal accepts narrative reviews under the "Review" content type, which "narratively summarize recent advances"

### 3.2 Characteristics Supporting Narrative Review Classification

| Characteristic | This Paper |
|---------------|------------|
| Literature search approach | Selective, thematic |
| Search protocol | Not pre-registered |
| Database coverage | Multiple sources, not exhaustive |
| Selection criteria | Applied during synthesis |
| Quality assessment | Expert judgment |
| Evidence synthesis | Thematic narrative |
| Meta-analysis | Not conducted |
| Original contribution | Three-pillar analytical framework |

### 3.3 Distinction from Systematic Review

| Feature | Systematic Review | This Paper |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Pre-registered protocol | Required (PROSPERO) | Not done |
| Exhaustive database search | Required | Selective |
| Reproducible search strategy | Documented precisely | Conceptual description |
| Dual screening | Standard practice | Single author |
| Formal quality assessment | GRADE, Cochrane tools | Expert judgment |
| PRISMA flow diagram | Required | Not applicable |
| Meta-analysis | Optional | Not applicable |

## 4. PRISMA Applicability Decision

### 4.1 Decision

**PRISMA 2020 Full Compliance: NOT REQUIRED**

### 4.2 Rationale

1. **Paper classification:** Explicitly a narrative review, not a systematic review
2. **No pre-registered protocol:** Retrospective PROSPERO registration is not possible
3. **Selective literature search:** Not designed as exhaustive systematic search
4. **Thematic synthesis:** Evidence integrated around analytical framework, not extracted systematically
5. **Target journal acceptance:** npj Digital Medicine accepts narrative reviews without PRISMA

### 4.3 PRISMA Extensions Assessment

| Extension | Applicable | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| PRISMA 2020 | No | For systematic reviews |
| PRISMA-ScR | No | For scoping reviews |
| PRISMA-S | No | Search reporting for systematic reviews |
| PRISMA-P | No | Review protocols |
| PRISMA-IPD | No | Individual participant data meta-analyses |
| PRISMA-NMA | No | Network meta-analyses |

## 5. PRISMA-Inspired Transparency Recommendations

### 5.1 Recommended Enhancements (Implemented in Paper)

Even though full PRISMA is not required, these transparency elements strengthen the paper:

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Literature search description** | Methodology section documents databases and search concepts |
| **Source selection criteria** | Inclusion/exclusion criteria stated |
| **Date range** | 2015-2024 with emphasis on 2020-2024 |
| **Synthesis approach** | Three-pillar framework described |
| **Methodological limitations** | Acknowledged in Methodology and Discussion sections |

### 5.2 NOT Recommended (Would Misrepresent Paper Type)

The following PRISMA elements should NOT be added, as they would misrepresent the methodology:

| Element | Reason to Exclude |
|---------|-------------------|
| PRISMA flow diagram | Implies systematic screening process |
| Formal risk of bias assessment | Implies systematic methodology |
| Protocol registration | Retrospective registration inappropriate |
| Comprehensive search strategy tables | Implies exhaustive search |
| PRISMA checklist claims | Would be inaccurate |

## 6. Journal-Specific Requirements

### 6.1 npj Digital Medicine (Primary Target)

- **Content type:** Review (narrative reviews accepted)
- **PRISMA requirement:** Not stated for Reviews
- **Relevant guidance:** "Reviews narratively summarize recent advances in a topic of interest"
- **Recommendation:** No PRISMA required; transparency elements enhance quality

### 6.2 JAMIA (Backup Target)

- **Systematic Review requirement:** PRISMA checklist required for systematic reviews
- **This paper classification:** Would be "Focus Article" or "Viewpoint," NOT "Systematic Review"
- **Recommendation:** If submitting to JAMIA, do NOT classify as systematic review

### 6.3 Preprint Servers

- **arXiv:** Recommended; accepts all paper types
- **medRxiv:** NOT eligible; explicitly excludes narrative reviews (only accepts systematic reviews with meta-analysis)

---

## 7. Quality Gate Updates

Based on this assessment, the following quality gate updates are recommended:

### 7.1 Previous Quality Gate (Incorrect)

```
PRISMA flow diagram completed
```

### 7.2 Updated Quality Gate (Correct)

```
Literature methodology transparency documented
Source selection criteria stated in paper
```

---

## 8. Conclusion

The paper is correctly classified as a narrative review with an original analytical framework. Full PRISMA 2020 compliance is not required and would misrepresent the methodology. The paper incorporates PRISMA-inspired transparency elements in the Methodology section to strengthen rigor without claiming systematic review methodology.

This assessment supports the current publication strategy:
- **Primary target:** npj Digital Medicine (accepts narrative reviews)
- **Preprint:** arXiv (not medRxiv)
- **Classification:** Article or Perspective, not Systematic Review
