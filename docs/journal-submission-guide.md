## Preprint and Repository Options

### arXiv (Computer Science / Health Informatics) - PRIMARY PREPRINT OPTION

**Focus**: CS, AI/ML, NLP, informatics preprints

**Details**:
- **URL**: https://arxiv.org/submit
- **Cost**: FREE
- **Timeline**: 24-72 hours for posting (after moderation)
- **DOI**: Provided immediately
- **Indexing**: Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, major databases
- **Requirement**: Endorsement required for first-time submitters

**Recommended Categories for Paper 1 (NL2SQL Healthcare Analytics)**:
- **Primary**: cs.CL (Computation and Language) - NL2SQL focus
- **Cross-list**: cs.DB (Databases) - SQL generation, data warehouses
- **Cross-list**: cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - user interfaces, democratization
- **Cross-list**: cs.CY (Computers and Society) - healthcare applications

**Why arXiv over medRxiv**:
- arXiv accepts narrative reviews, analytical frameworks, and position papers
- medRxiv explicitly excludes narrative reviews (only accepts systematic reviews with meta-analysis)

**Strategy**:
- Post preprint of Paper 1 to arXiv after completion
- Establishes priority and thought leadership
- Does not preclude journal submission (npj Digital Medicine allows preprints)

**Best Fit**: All three papers (Paper 1 especially given narrative review format)

---

### medRxiv (Healthcare Sciences Preprints) - NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PAPER 1

**Purpose**: Rapid dissemination before peer review

**Details**:
- **URL**: https://www.medrxiv.org/submit-a-manuscript
- **Cost**: FREE
- **Timeline**: 24-72 hours for posting
- **DOI**: Provided immediately
- **Indexing**: Google Scholar, some databases

**Scope Limitations** (as of Dec 2025):
- **Accepts**: Original research, systematic reviews with meta-analysis, scoping reviews with meta-analysis, methodological research, clinical protocols
- **Does NOT accept**: Narrative reviews, hypotheses without data, opinion pieces, editorials, case reports

**Paper 1 Status**: **NOT ELIGIBLE** - Paper 1 is a narrative review with an analytical framework, which medRxiv explicitly excludes.

**Recommended for**: Papers 2 and 3 only (if they include empirical primary research)

---

## Conference Proceedings (Complementary Strategy)

### AMIA Annual Symposium

**Organization**: American Medical Informatics Association

## Risk Mitigation for Journal Submission

### Common Rejection Reasons

1. **Out of Scope**: Ensure manuscript aligns with journal's stated focus areas
2. **Insufficient Novelty**: Emphasize unique contributions (3-pillar framework, empirical validation)
3. **Methodological Issues**: Follow appropriate reporting guidelines (PRISMA for systematic reviews, CONSORT for trials). Note: Paper 1 is a narrative review - methodology transparency is documented but full PRISMA not required
4. **Poor Writing Quality**: Professional editing recommended before submission
5. **Incomplete Data Sharing**: Prepare supplementary materials in advance

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Pre-submission inquiries**: Contact editors to confirm fit
- **Author guidelines compliance**: Follow formatting meticulously
- **Internal review**: Peer review by backup developer and SMEs before submission
- **Manuscript editing**: Budget for professional editing service if needed
- **Parallel preparation**: Prepare backups for alternative journals while awaiting decision

---

## Post-Publication Promotion Strategy

### After Acceptance

1. **Institutional Press Release**: Coordinate with Yuimedi marketing
2. **Social Media**: LinkedIn, Twitter/X announcements
3. **Conference Presentations**: HIMSS, AMIA, regional HIE conferences
4. **Blog Posts**: 3-5 blog posts per paper highlighting key findings
5. **Webinar Series**: Present findings to healthcare analytics community
6. **ResearchGate/Academia.edu**: Upload preprints and accepted manuscripts

### Metrics Tracking

- Citation count (Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science)
- Altmetric score (social media mentions, news coverage)
- Download statistics
- Speaking invitation rate
- Inbound business inquiries

---

## Special Considerations

### Predatory Journal Avoidance

**Red Flags to Avoid**:

**Verification Tools**:
- Beall's List awareness (archived, but still useful)
- Think.Check.Submit checklist
- Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) listing

### Journal Policy Compliance

**Yuimedi Considerations**:
- **Proprietary Information**: Ensure no trade secrets disclosed
- **Intellectual Property**: Confirm open access doesn't limit commercialization

3. Present Paper 1 findings at conferences (if accepted)

**Q2 2026 Actions**:
1. Submit Paper 3 to arXiv
2. Target Journal of Biomedical Informatics or ACI
3. Leverage Paper 1 citations in Papers 2 and 3 submissions

### Success Metrics

- **3 preprints** published (medRxiv/arXiv) - immediate thought leadership
- **2+ peer-reviewed publications** within 12 months
