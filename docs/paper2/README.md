# Paper 2: Proof of Concept

## Focus
YuiQuery's capability with worst-case healthcare data scenarios

## Deadline
December 20, 2025

## Key Deliverables
- Algorithm implementation for schema inference
- Performance metrics (>85% accuracy target)
- Testing with degraded healthcare data
- Programmatic inference of primary/foreign keys
- Semantic understanding from value distributions

## Technical Components
- Natural language to SQL translation
- Schema discovery without documentation
- Handling missing column names
- Data quality assessment algorithms

## Success Metrics
- Algorithm achieves >85% accuracy in schema inference
- Successfully processes real degraded healthcare data
- Demonstrates 50% time reduction vs manual methods
