## Summary of Findings

Google Scholar Labs found 10 peer-reviewed papers (2021-2025) directly addressing cost reductions and ROI from low-code platform implementations in healthcare. The evidence is strong and consistent: studies report 67-70% reductions in development time, 177-250% ROI over 36-month periods, and significant operational savings including reduced technical resource requirements (58% fewer resources) and administrative burden reductions. This fills the previously identified gap for low-code platform evidence in healthcare contexts.

## Relevance to Three-Pillar Framework

1. **Analytics maturity:** Low-code platforms enable healthcare organizations at lower analytics maturity levels to rapidly develop data applications without specialized technical staff, accelerating analytics capability development
2. **Workforce turnover:** Visual development and standardized components reduce dependency on specialized developers, mitigating knowledge loss when technical staff leave; applications can be maintained by business analysts
3. **Technical barriers:** Low-code platforms abstract technical complexity, enabling citizen developers to create healthcare applications; 67-70% faster development addresses resource constraints

---

## Gaps Identified

- **Long-term sustainability studies:** Most studies examine 3-year ROI; limited evidence on 5-10 year total cost of ownership
- **Scalability limitations:** Evidence primarily from small-to-medium implementations; enterprise-scale validation limited
- **Regulatory compliance costs:** While compliance benefits mentioned, quantified regulatory cost savings limited
- **Vendor lock-in considerations:** Limited analysis of long-term vendor dependency costs

---

## Suggested Follow-up Questions

**From Scholar Labs:**
1. Not provided

**Based on Literature Gaps:**
1. What are the long-term (5-10 year) total cost of ownership comparisons between low-code and traditional development in healthcare?
2. How do low-code platform implementations scale in large health systems (1000+ bed hospitals)?
