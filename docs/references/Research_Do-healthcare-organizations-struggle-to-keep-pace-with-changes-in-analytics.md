# Do Healthcare Organizations Struggle to Keep Pace with Changes in Analytics?

## Overview

Yes, healthcare organizations do struggle to keep pace with changes in analytics as a discipline. The academic literature consistently supports this finding across multiple dimensions.

## Key Findings

### 1. Healthcare Lags Behind Other Industries

Healthcare's adoption of information technology and analytics often lags behind other sectors such as retailing and banking (Wang, Kung & Byrd, 2018; Wang & Hajli, 2017). Big data analytics remains in an early stage of development within healthcare, partly due to the complexity of implementing new technology in clinical environments (Wang, Kung & Byrd, 2018).

### 2. Data Volume Exceeds Processing Capacity

The increasing volume of health data has exceeded the ability of health organizations to process it effectively for improving clinical and financial efficiencies and quality of care (Carvalho, Rocha & Vasconcelos, 2019). The exponential growth of health data, combined with pressure for continuous investment and the necessity for integrated care services, creates demanding pace-of-change requirements that many organizations struggle to meet.

### 3. Workforce and Skills Gaps

There is an acknowledged problem in health services where organizations cannot make good use of available data due to a deficit in skilled analysts across all sectors and levels (Bardsley, 2016). Some healthcare professionals do not understand data analytics or how collected data is used (Loizou, Xu, Moody & Arnab, 2020). Organizations face critical challenges in recruiting and retaining professionals with the right analytical skills, while the need for big data specialists with analytical capabilities continues to grow (Pesqueira, Sousa & Rocha, 2020).

### 4. Cultural and Organizational Barriers

Cultural and regulatory obstacles for data sharing limit the ability of healthcare organizations to achieve the full potential of their data sets (Mayo, Deasy, Chera & Freymann, 2016). Healthcare organizations need a cultural shift to prioritize thinking about data entered for each patient as information for analysis and improvement, rather than just what is needed for treatment. The lack of data on key elements that are systematically aggregated and curated for all patients remains the biggest obstacle to becoming more data-driven.

### 5. Resistance to Change and Security Concerns

The security of information is a main reason for the slow pace of big data analytics adoption in healthcare organizations (Shahbaz, Gao, Zhai, Shahzad & Hu, 2019). Employee resistance to change is identified as a key factor underlying the failure of innovative systems and a key barrier that slows down the pace of information system acceptance in the health sector.

### 6. Fragmented Systems and Infrastructure

Despite the promise of AI and predictive analytics, persistent obstacles to widespread adoption include fragmented IT systems and interoperability gaps (Urbi & Tiva, 2025). Traditional approaches to hospital management, which often rely on retrospective reporting, are inadequate for the demands of modern analytics, implying that organizations need a structured way to manage these challenges.

## Conclusion

The evidence strongly indicates healthcare organizations face multi-faceted challenges (including skills gaps, cultural resistance, infrastructure limitations, security concerns, and organizational inertia) that collectively impede their ability to keep pace with advances in analytics as a discipline. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated investment in workforce development, cultural transformation, and technological infrastructure.
