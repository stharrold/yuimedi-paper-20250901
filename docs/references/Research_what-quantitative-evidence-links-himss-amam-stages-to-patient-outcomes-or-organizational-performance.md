## Summary of Findings

**Status: PARTIAL** - Related EMRAM evidence exists, but AMAM-specific evidence is a confirmed gap.

The search found **10 peer-reviewed sources** addressing quantitative links between digital maturity and outcomes, but **all use HIMSS EMRAM (Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model), not AMAM (Analytics Maturity Assessment Model)**. This is a critical distinction:

- **EMRAM** = EHR adoption stages 0-7 (Does the hospital have integrated EHR?)
- **AMAM** = Analytics capability stages (Can the organization do predictive analytics, self-service BI, AI-driven insights?)

**AMAM was released October 2024**, so no peer-reviewed AMAM-specific outcome studies exist yet. The EMRAM evidence shows mixed but generally positive associations: advanced EHR maturity correlates with better safety grades (3.25x higher odds), reduced infection rates, and improved operational costs, though some studies find no significant link to mortality or readmissions.

**Gap Confirmed:** No quantitative evidence yet links HIMSS AMAM stages specifically to patient outcomes or organizational performance. The EMRAM evidence provides indirect support but measures a different construct (EHR adoption vs. analytics maturity).

**Abstract/Summary:**
Demonstrates that hospitals with advanced digital maturity (EMRAM levels 6 or 7) had 3.25 times higher odds of achieving a better Leapfrog Group Hospital Safety Grade compared to hospitals with underdeveloped maturity (EMRAM level 0), suggesting a quantitative link between digital maturity and performance.

**Methodology/Approach:** Cross-sectional observational study; statistical analysis of 1,026 US hospitals

**Key Points:**
- Hospitals with advanced digital maturity (EMRAM 6-7) showed **3.25x higher odds** of achieving better Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grades
- Statistically significant reductions in infection rates and adverse events at higher maturity levels
- Improvements in surgical safety outcomes correlated with HIMSS EMRAM stages

**Abstract/Summary:**
Examines the relationship between organizational digital maturity, characterized using the 2016 NHS Clinical Digital Maturity Index (CDMI), and five key clinical outcome measures in secondary care within the English National Health Service.

**Methodology/Approach:** Multivariable regression analysis of NHS hospitals

**Key Points:**
- **No significant relationship** found between digital maturity and risk-adjusted 30-day mortality, 28-day readmission rates, or complications of care

- Digitally mature hospitals may deliver more harm-free care but also have higher risk of long length of stay
- Uses UK-specific CDMI rather than HIMSS model

**Relationship to Other Papers:** Provides important counterbalance showing mixed results; contrasts with more positive US findings

## Key Themes and Observations

1. **EMRAM as Primary Measure:** Most studies use HIMSS EMRAM (EHR adoption stages 0-7) rather than the newer AMAM (Analytics Maturity Assessment Model, October 2024). This reflects EMRAM's longer history and availability of longitudinal data.

2. **Mixed Results for Mortality/Readmissions:** Studies show inconsistent findings for hard clinical outcomes like mortality and readmissions, with some finding no significant association (Martin 2019, Saint-Ulysse 2021) while others find improvements (Hosfield 2017).

3. **Stronger Evidence for Safety/Quality:** More consistent positive associations found for safety grades, infection rates, adverse events, and harm-free care (Snowdon 2024, Martin 2019).

4. **Organizational Performance Links:** Strong evidence linking analytics/digital maturity to financial performance, efficiency, and operational costs (Ashik 2023, Thrasher 2007).

5. **Analytics-Specific Evidence Emerging:** Recent studies (Khandelwal 2025, Wang 2019) focus specifically on analytics capabilities and show strong ROI and outcome improvements, which is more directly relevant to AMAM.

## Relevance to Three-Pillar Framework

1. **Analytics maturity:** **Directly relevant.** This research question addresses the core of the analytics maturity pillar, providing quantitative evidence that higher HIMSS EMRAM/AMAM stages correlate with better safety grades (3.25x), reduced infections, and improved operational performance. However, the evidence for hard clinical outcomes (mortality, readmissions) is mixed.

2. **Workforce turnover:** **Indirectly relevant.** Analytics maturity may reduce reliance on institutional knowledge by embedding decision support in systems. Wang (2019) notes that analytical personnel skills are necessary conditions for achieving low readmission rates, suggesting workforce capability matters alongside technology.

3. **Technical barriers:** **Moderately relevant.** The studies highlight that achieving high maturity stages (EMRAM 6-7) requires overcoming significant technical barriers. The finding that rural, nonprofit, and nonaffiliated hospitals have lower adoption rates (Hosfield 2017) indicates technical/resource barriers affect both maturity and outcomes.

---

## Gaps Identified

1. **AMAM-Specific Evidence:** No studies yet use the HIMSS AMAM (Analytics Maturity Assessment Model) released October 2024. All evidence uses EMRAM or other EHR-focused maturity models. Research specifically validating AMAM stages against outcomes is needed.

2. **Longitudinal AMAM Studies:** Need prospective studies tracking organizations as they advance through AMAM stages to establish causality.

3. **Analytics vs. EHR Maturity Distinction:** Limited research distinguishing between EHR adoption maturity (EMRAM) and analytics capability maturity (AMAM) in their differential effects on outcomes.

4. **Mechanism Studies:** Most studies show correlations but don't explain *how* maturity improves outcomes (e.g., through better decision support, reduced errors, faster diagnoses).

5. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Limited evidence on ROI of advancing through maturity stages, though Khandelwal (2025) begins to address this for predictive analytics.

---

## Suggested Follow-up Questions

**From Scholar Labs:**
1. What specific clinical decision support capabilities differentiate EMRAM Stage 6 from Stage 7 hospitals?
2. How do healthcare organizations measure and validate their progression through analytics maturity stages?
3. What organizational factors predict successful advancement through HIMSS maturity stages?

**Based on Literature Gaps:**
1. How does HIMSS AMAM (released October 2024) differ from EMRAM in predicting patient outcomes?
2. What is the ROI of advancing from AMAM Stage 3 to Stage 5 in a typical health system?
3. Does analytics maturity reduce the impact of workforce turnover on care quality?

## Industry Sources Summary

Industry sources confirm:

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| AMAM24 launched October 2, 2024 | HIMSS Official |
| 8-stage model (0-7) | Healthcare IT News |
| Outcomes-focused (clinical care, operational efficiency) | HIMSS GKC |
| First Stage 7: King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh (June 2025) | Healthcare IT News |
| Workforce metrics: tool usability, adoption rates | Healthcare IT News |
| AI/ML integration at Stages 6-7 | Healthcare IT News |

**Gap Status Update:** Industry sources confirm AMAM24 is outcomes-focused with measurable ROI emphasis, but **no peer-reviewed outcome studies yet exist** linking AMAM stages to patient outcomes or organizational performance. The first Stage 7 achievement (June 2025) is too recent for outcome data. Academic evidence remains limited to EMRAM (EHR adoption), not AMAM (analytics maturity).
