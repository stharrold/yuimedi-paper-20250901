## Summary of Findings

Peer-reviewed evidence strongly supports NL2SQL productivity gains over traditional SQL development. Quantified benefits include 67% reduction in query latency (Parashar et al., 2025), 32.6% latency decrease with usage scaling (Bajpoti et al., 2025), and industry validation with 10,000+ weekly users at <1% feature disablement rate (Maddila et al., 2025). A survey of software engineering professionals found text-to-SQL approaches "less time-consuming and helpful" compared to traditional methods (Tomova et al., 2024). Key benefits consistently identified: democratized data access for non-technical users, reduced dependence on specialized technical skills, faster decision-making cycles, and elimination of tedious boilerplate SQL coding.

## Comparison to Healthcare AI Cost Evidence

Unlike the healthcare AI cost evidence (which documented clinical application savings but not analytics/NL2SQL), this search found **direct evidence** for NL2SQL productivity gains:

| Aspect | Healthcare AI Evidence | NL2SQL Evidence |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Domain | Clinical (diagnosis, treatment) | Analytics/Database |
| Metrics | Cost savings ($149M-$360B) | Time savings (32-67% reduction) |
| User Studies | Limited | Survey + 10,000 user deployment |
| Relevance to Paper 1 | Indirect (general AI benefits) | **Direct** (analytics productivity) |
