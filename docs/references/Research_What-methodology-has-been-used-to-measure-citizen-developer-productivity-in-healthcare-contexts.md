## Summary of Findings

The literature search found 10 relevant papers spanning 1990-2025, primarily addressing **end-user computing (EUC)** measurement methodologies that are applicable to citizen developer productivity. While direct measurement of "citizen developer productivity in healthcare" is sparse, several established frameworks exist: End-User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS), Task-Technology Fit (TTF), and structural equation modeling approaches. Only 2-3 papers specifically address citizen development, with Callinan & Perry (2024) providing the most directly relevant Critical Success Factors framework. Healthcare-specific applications exist but typically adapt general EUC frameworks rather than developing healthcare-specific citizen developer metrics.

**Key Finding:** The citizen developer productivity measurement literature is nascent; most research builds on decades of EUC satisfaction/effectiveness research, with healthcare contexts representing adaptation rather than native development.

## Key Themes and Observations

1. **End-User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) Dominance:** The most established measurement approach uses satisfaction scales (12+ items) as proxies for productivity, with decades of validation.

2. **Task-Technology Fit (TTF) for Healthcare:** TTF models have been specifically adapted for healthcare IT evaluation, providing validated instruments.

3. **Structural Equation Modeling:** SEM/PLS techniques commonly used to establish construct validity and relationships between satisfaction, use, and performance.

4. **Nascent Citizen Developer Research:** Only Callinan & Perry (2024) directly addresses citizen developer CSFs; most literature addresses "end-user computing" more broadly.

5. **Healthcare Adaptation Pattern:** Healthcare applications typically adapt existing EUC frameworks rather than developing healthcare-specific citizen developer metrics.

## Relevance to Three-Pillar Framework

1. **Analytics maturity:** EUCS and TTF frameworks can measure analytics tool adoption and effectiveness; Callinan's CSFs (Operational Efficiency, Time Savings, Timeframe to Realize Value) directly applicable to analytics maturity assessment.

2. **Workforce turnover:** The "institutional learning" aspect is not directly addressed; however, Number of Sponsored Ideas and Employee Engagement CSFs from Callinan & Perry could serve as proxies for knowledge retention. The EUC competency framework (Yoon 2008) could measure onboarding effectiveness.

3. **Technical barriers:** Task-Technology Fit model directly measures alignment between user tasks and system capabilities; low-code evaluation metrics (Chen et al. 2025) demonstrate how technical barriers can be quantified via model performance benchmarks.

---

## Gaps Identified

1. **No validated "citizen developer productivity" instrument for healthcare:** Existing instruments measure EUC satisfaction/effectiveness but don't specifically target citizen developer role in healthcare.

2. **Limited healthcare-specific citizen developer studies:** Callinan & Perry (2024) CSFs are domain-agnostic; no healthcare-specific adaptation exists.

3. **No longitudinal productivity measurement:** All studies use cross-sectional designs; no before/after citizen development adoption studies found.

4. **Missing ROI/cost-effectiveness frameworks:** Productivity measured but not linked to financial outcomes in healthcare contexts.

5. **No comparison methodology:** No validated approach for comparing citizen developer productivity to traditional developer productivity in healthcare.

---

## Suggested Follow-up Questions

**From Scholar Labs:**
1. What specific metrics have been used to evaluate low-code platform effectiveness in healthcare organizations?
2. How has end-user computing satisfaction been measured in clinical decision support systems?
3. What frameworks exist for measuring business intelligence end-user performance in hospitals?

**Based on Literature Gaps:**
1. How can Callinan & Perry's citizen developer CSFs be adapted for healthcare-specific contexts?
2. What longitudinal study designs would be appropriate for measuring citizen developer productivity over time?
3. How should citizen developer productivity be compared against traditional IT development productivity?
