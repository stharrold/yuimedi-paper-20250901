## Summary of Findings

Two Google Scholar Labs searches found 20 relevant papers spanning 1990-2025, addressing **end-user computing (EUC)** measurement methodologies applicable to citizen developer productivity. The supplementary search (December 2025) found additional papers with **healthcare-specific quantitative metrics**:

**Key New Findings (Supplementary Search):**
- **67% development time reduction** in healthcare low-code implementations (Mogili 2025)
- **50% IT backlog decrease, 40% operational efficiency improvement** in global healthcare organization (Salvatore 2024)
- **41% patient satisfaction enhancement** from low-code patient engagement apps (Mogili 2025)
- **30% higher strategic objective achievement** with defined LCDP success metrics (Salvatore 2024)
- **CD Score index** for evaluating low-code platforms' citizen development support (Waszkowski 2025, Nature)
- **46 indicators across 21 sub-domains** for healthcare workforce performance (Agarwal et al. 2019, 157 citations)

**Gap Status:** Despite additional evidence, healthcare-specific citizen developer productivity measurement methodology remains a confirmed gap. Available frameworks are either domain-agnostic citizen developer metrics (Callinan & Perry CSFs, CD Score) or general healthcare productivity metrics not specific to citizen developers.

## Key Themes and Observations

1. **End-User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) Dominance:** The most established measurement approach uses satisfaction scales (12+ items) as proxies for productivity, with decades of validation.

2. **Task-Technology Fit (TTF) for Healthcare:** TTF models have been specifically adapted for healthcare IT evaluation, providing validated instruments.

3. **Structural Equation Modeling:** SEM/PLS techniques commonly used to establish construct validity and relationships between satisfaction, use, and performance.

4. **Nascent Citizen Developer Research:** Only Callinan & Perry (2024) directly addresses citizen developer CSFs; most literature addresses "end-user computing" more broadly.

5. **Healthcare Adaptation Pattern:** Healthcare applications typically adapt existing EUC frameworks rather than developing healthcare-specific citizen developer metrics.

6. **NEW - Quantitative Healthcare Low-Code Metrics:** Supplementary search found specific metrics:
   - 67% development time reduction (Mogili 2025)
   - 50% IT backlog decrease (Salvatore 2024)
   - 40% operational efficiency improvement (Salvatore 2024)
   - 41% patient satisfaction enhancement (Mogili 2025)
   - CD Score index for platform evaluation (Waszkowski 2025)

7. **NEW - Healthcare Workforce Framework:** Agarwal et al. (2019) provides 46 indicators across 21 sub-domains that could be adapted for citizen developer contexts.

## Relevance to Three-Pillar Framework

1. **Analytics maturity:** EUCS and TTF frameworks can measure analytics tool adoption and effectiveness; Callinan's CSFs (Operational Efficiency, Time Savings, Timeframe to Realize Value) directly applicable to analytics maturity assessment. NEW: Mogili (2025) 67% development time reduction demonstrates low-code acceleration of analytics capability development.

2. **Workforce turnover:** The "institutional learning" aspect is not directly addressed; however, Number of Sponsored Ideas and Employee Engagement CSFs from Callinan & Perry could serve as proxies for knowledge retention. The EUC competency framework (Yoon 2008) could measure onboarding effectiveness. NEW: Salvatore (2024) 30% IT productivity improvement shows citizen development can offset workforce constraints.

3. **Technical barriers:** Task-Technology Fit model directly measures alignment between user tasks and system capabilities; low-code evaluation metrics (Chen et al. 2025) demonstrate how technical barriers can be quantified via model performance benchmarks. NEW: CD Score (Waszkowski 2025) provides standardized method to evaluate platform technical accessibility for non-IT staff.

---

## Gaps Identified

1. **No validated "citizen developer productivity" instrument for healthcare:** Existing instruments measure EUC satisfaction/effectiveness but don't specifically target citizen developer role in healthcare.

2. **Limited healthcare-specific citizen developer studies:** Callinan & Perry (2024) CSFs are domain-agnostic; Salvatore (2024) provides healthcare case study but not validated instrument.

3. **No longitudinal productivity measurement:** All studies use cross-sectional designs; no before/after citizen development adoption studies found.

4. **Missing ROI/cost-effectiveness frameworks:** Productivity measured but not systematically linked to financial outcomes in healthcare contexts.

5. **No comparison methodology:** No validated approach for comparing citizen developer productivity to traditional developer productivity in healthcare.

---

## Gap Validation (December 2025)

**Gap Status: CONFIRMED** - Despite finding 20 papers across two searches, healthcare-specific citizen developer productivity measurement methodology remains a genuine literature gap. Available frameworks are either:
- Domain-agnostic citizen developer metrics (Callinan & Perry CSFs, CD Score, PMI Citizen Developer)
- Healthcare productivity metrics not specific to citizen developers (Agarwal 46 indicators, Lapointe HIT framework)
- Quantitative metrics from individual case studies (Mogili, Salvatore) not yet validated as generalizable instruments

---

## Suggested Follow-up Questions

**From Scholar Labs:**
1. What specific metrics have been used to evaluate low-code platform effectiveness in healthcare organizations?
2. How has end-user computing satisfaction been measured in clinical decision support systems?
3. What frameworks exist for measuring business intelligence end-user performance in hospitals?

**Based on Literature Gaps:**
1. How can Callinan & Perry's citizen developer CSFs be adapted for healthcare-specific contexts?
2. What longitudinal study designs would be appropriate for measuring citizen developer productivity over time?
3. How should citizen developer productivity be compared against traditional IT development productivity?
