# Average Tenure for IT Staff at Healthcare Provider Institutions

## Summary

Research indicates that information technology staff at healthcare provider institutions have an average tenure of approximately 2.9 to 4-6 years [1][2], which is notably lower than IT professionals in other sectors [1].

## Key Findings

### 1. Technical IT Staff at Healthcare Providers: ~2.9 years

- Healthcare provider institutions where IT serves as a support function have the lowest expected tenure among IT organizations [1]

### 2. Hospital IT Personnel: 4-6 years

- This broader estimate includes medical and administrative staff using IT systems [2]

### 3. Comparison with Other IT Sectors

| Sector/Strategy | Average Tenure |
|-----------------|----------------|
| IT managerial jobs overall | 9.68 years [1] |
| Organizations with industrial ILM strategies | 14.1 years [1] |
| Organizations with craft ILM strategies | 3.4 years [1] |
| **Healthcare IT (technical staff)** | **2.9 years** [1] |

## Conclusion

Healthcare IT professionals experience significantly higher turnover and shorter tenure compared to other industries [1][4], with technical IT staff averaging around 3 years at healthcare provider institutions [1]. Studies suggest that the quality of relationships between IT professionals and their leaders may influence retention outcomes [3], and addressing voluntary attrition remains a key challenge for healthcare technology organizations [4].
