## Summary of Findings

Nonaka's SECI model (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) provides a theoretical framework for understanding how tacit knowledge becomes explicit and institutionalized within organizations. In analytics contexts, the model has been applied to explain knowledge transformation across business intelligence maturity levels, with recent work exploring how AI tools can enhance the externalization process, converting tacit analytical knowledge into explicit, reusable forms. The KMSP-Q questionnaire offers an empirically validated instrument for operationalizing SECI constructs. Key applications include: data mining techniques mapping to internalization stages for actionable insights, big data environments supporting combination and internalization modes, and knowledge-intensive clusters using SECI processes for external knowledge acquisition.

## 4. Tax explicit knowledge creation: application of combination mode of socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization model

**Authors:** U Okoh, P Jehu, A Abubakar
**Publication:** International Journal of Intellectual Capital, 2022
**Citations:** 1

**Key Points:**
- Explains the Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization (SECI) model as a widely used knowledge creation model that anchors knowledge on the continuous interaction of tacit and explicit knowledge
- **Combination Mode Activities:** Focuses on the Combination mode of the SECI model, which converts existing explicit knowledge into a more sophisticated, systematic, complex, and efficient explicit knowledge, specifically identifying reformulation and update as key activities in a tax administration context
- **Knowledge Transformation Forms:** Details how explicit knowledge is transformed in the Combination mode into forms such as manuals, reports, written documents, procedures, and databases, which are relevant to organizational knowledge capture and subsequent analysis

**Authors:** E Mardiani, A Samsuryadi
**Publication:** International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 2023
**Citations:** 3

**Key Points:**
- Explains that data mining and data science clarify processes in the SECI model quadrant regarding technological tools in the context of knowledge transfer between tacit and explicit knowledge
- **Information Technology and SECI:** Details the application of information technology, specifically data mining, to reduce human error in the knowledge transfer process within the SECI model
- **Analytics in SECI Stages:** Outlines how data mining functionalities, such as classification, clustering, and association, are used in the internalization stage of the SECI model to produce actionable analysis and recommendations for organizational strategy

## 6. Towards integrated model of big data (BD), business intelligence (BI) and knowledge management (KM)

**Authors:** S Kamoun-Chouk, H Berger, BH Sie
**Publication:** International Conference on Knowledge Management, 2017 (Springer)

**Key Points:**
- Explains the SECI model processes (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization) for creating and transforming knowledge within enterprises, presenting a dynamic spiral ascent model where employees share knowledge and transform individual knowledge into collective knowledge
- **SECI in Big Data Context:** Mentions previous research applied the SECI theoretical model to the context of big data, presenting a dynamic transformation capability of knowledge and the knowledge creation process in the big data environment, which was verified from the perspectives of business analysis and technical management
- **Externalization in LLMs:** Analyzes the SECI model's externalization stage for Large Language Models (LLMs), which transforms the acquired tacit knowledge into explicit and shareable forms by translating the model's internal language knowledge into an external language for other models or systems

## Key Themes and Observations

1. **SECI Operationalization:** The KMSP-Q questionnaire (Farnese et al., 2019) provides a validated instrument for measuring SECI processes, enabling empirical research on knowledge conversion in organizational settings.

2. **AI Enhancement of SECI:** Recent work (Zhang et al., 2025) demonstrates that AI tools can enhance all four SECI stages, particularly facilitating tacit-to-explicit conversion during externalization through large language models and data processing.

3. **BI Maturity Alignment:** The SECI model maps to business intelligence maturity levels (Kašparová & Michalová, 2023), providing a theoretical lens for understanding how analytics capabilities evolve with knowledge management practices.

4. **Data Mining in Internalization:** Classification, clustering, and association techniques from data mining directly support the internalization stage, converting explicit analytical outputs into actionable organizational knowledge (Mardiani & Samsuryadi, 2023).

5. **Big Data Integration:** The SECI model has been extended to big data contexts, with combination and internalization modes particularly relevant for transforming large-scale data into organizational knowledge (Kamoun-Chouk et al., 2017).

6. **External Knowledge Capture:** Organizations in knowledge-intensive environments use modified SECI processes for acquiring external knowledge, combining externalization with explicit knowledge processing (López-Sáez & Navas-López, 2010).

7. **Practical Implementation:** Empirical applications like "obeya" rooms in automotive demonstrate that SECI provides actionable frameworks for knowledge capture beyond theoretical constructs (Canonico et al., 2020).
