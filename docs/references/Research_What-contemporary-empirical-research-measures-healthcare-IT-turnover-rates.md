## Summary of Findings

This search was conducted to identify **contemporary alternatives** to the heavily-cited Ang & Slaughter (2004) study, which provides the primary healthcare IT turnover data (2.9 years tenure / 34% turnover) used in Paper1. Google Scholar Labs found 10 papers (2015-2025) providing more recent quantitative data on healthcare IT workforce turnover. The most significant finding is **Rajamani et al. (2025)** reporting that **55% of US public health informatics specialists intended to leave their positions** based on a nationally representative 2021 survey of 44,732 respondents. Additional contemporary evidence includes **64.8% intent to leave** among Ethiopian health IT professionals (Zimamu 2021) and **25.6% actual turnover** in the ICT sector from Spanish labor force data (Suárez-Albanchez 2021).

### Gap Analysis Conclusion

**The 2004 Ang & Slaughter data remains the most cited source** for healthcare IT-specific tenure data, but contemporary evidence suggests the turnover situation may be **worse than the 2004 baseline**:

| Source | Year | Metric | Finding |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| Ang & Slaughter | **2004** | Tenure | 2.9 years (~34% implied turnover) |
| Rajamani et al. | **2025** (2021 data) | Intent to leave | **55%** of public health informatics specialists |
| Zimamu & Wubet | **2021** | Intent to leave | **64.8%** of health IT professionals |
| Suárez-Albanchez et al. | **2021** (2018 data) | Actual turnover | **25.6%** in ICT sector |

## Synthesis for Paper1

### Contemporary Data vs. 2004 Baseline

| Metric | Ang & Slaughter (2004) | Contemporary Evidence |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Primary Citation** | 2.9 years tenure | Rajamani 2025: 55% intent to leave |
| **Implied/Actual Turnover** | ~34% (calculated) | Suárez-Albanchez 2021: 25.6% actual |
| **Sample** | IT professionals (general) | Health informatics specialists |
| **Geography** | US | US (Rajamani), International |
| **Data Year** | Pre-2004 | 2018-2021 |

### Key Implications

1. **The 2004 data may understate current turnover:** The Rajamani 2025 finding of 55% intent to leave among US public health informatics specialists (2021 data) suggests turnover pressure may have increased since 2004.

2. **Intent to leave vs. actual turnover:** The contemporary studies primarily measure intent to leave (55-65%) rather than actual turnover. The Spanish labor force data (25.6% actual) provides a benchmark, though this is general ICT rather than healthcare-specific.

3. **Healthcare IT context validated:** Multiple studies confirm healthcare IT as a distinct workforce segment with turnover challenges (Zimamu 2021, Rajamani 2025, Zheng 2016).

### Recommendations for Paper1

**Option A - Update citation:** Replace or supplement [A10] (Ang & Slaughter 2004) with Rajamani et al. (2025) for US public health informatics data.

**Option B - Acknowledge temporal context:** Retain [A10] but add explicit temporal qualification noting that contemporary evidence (Rajamani 2025) suggests the challenge persists or has worsened.

**Option C - Document as methodological note:** Add to methodology section that workforce turnover data relies on 2004 baseline with acknowledgment of limited contemporary replication studies, while citing Rajamani 2025 as supporting evidence that the pattern continues.

### Evidence Quality Assessment

| Study | Quality Indicators | Limitation |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Rajamani 2025 | Nationally representative (n=44,732), peer-reviewed, recent (2021 data) | Intent to leave, not actual turnover |
| Suárez-Albanchez 2021 | Labor force survey data, actual turnover, peer-reviewed | Spanish context, general ICT not healthcare |
| Zimamu 2021 | Healthcare IT specific, quantitative | Ethiopian context, preprint, small sample (n=122) |
| Annabi 2018 | 170 citations, includes healthcare case | Gender-specific, general IT |

### Literature Gap Confirmed

This search confirms a **methodological gap**: No contemporary study directly replicates Ang & Slaughter's (2004) methodology to measure healthcare IT tenure/turnover in US healthcare organizations. The Rajamani 2025 study provides the closest contemporary equivalent for healthcare informatics workforce but measures intent to leave rather than actual tenure or turnover rates.

This gap could be noted in Paper1's limitations or as a direction for future research.
