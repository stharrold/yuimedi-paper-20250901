# Research: Centralized Semantic Models vs. Shadow IT

**Question:** Does the rigidity of centralized semantic models drive analysts toward 'Shadow IT' (extracting raw data to Excel), thereby defeating the governance model? Can conversational interfaces offer the flexibility to prevent this?

**Scope:** Paper1 (Analytical Framework)

## Key Findings

Literature confirms a direct link between the rigidity of centralized IT systems and the emergence of "Shadow IT" (workarounds), highlighting the need for more agile governance models.

1.  **Rigidity as a Driver:** Zimmermann & Rentrop (2017, 70 citations) empirically demonstrate that high demands for flexibility from business users—particularly in rapidly changing environments—are a primary driver of Shadow IT. When central IT cannot keep pace with user needs, users implement their own solutions.
2.  **Governance Ineffectiveness:** Traditional data governance often fails because it cannot handle the "overwhelming complexity of data" and the speed of change, leading to workarounds that defeat the intended governance (Oliveira et al., 2023).
3.  **Prevention through Agility:** Oliveira et al. (2023) introduce "Data Governance 4.0," which leverages agile, metadata-driven frameworks and semantic web principles to adapt governance constraints to specific use cases.
4.  **Embracing Flexibility:** Rather than suppressing flexible tools like Excel, modern frameworks attempt to integrate them into the governance lifecycle (e.g., using "Excel Enricher templates") to capture knowledge while maintaining control, potentially offering a path for conversational interfaces to provide similar "governed flexibility" (Oliveira et al., 2023).
