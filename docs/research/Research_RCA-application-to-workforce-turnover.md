# Research Question: How has Root Cause Analysis (RCA) been applied to workforce turnover in healthcare to identify systemic drivers?

**Motivation:** Validates the application of RCA logic to the "Workforce Agility" pillar, framing turnover as a systemic symptom rather than just an individual choice.

**Key Findings:**

1.  **Systemic Analysis:** Eriksson et al. (2022) used a case study approach to analyze nurse turnover across five system levels (micro to macro), explicitly identifying systemic drivers like lack of "buffering factors" and "not owning one's spare time."
2.  **5-Whys Application:** Al-Ogaidi (2025) documents the use of the "5-Whys" technique within a Lean Six Sigma framework to question emerging themes in high turnover, creating causal maps that trace issues back to inefficient onboarding and variable training.
3.  **Quantitative RCA:** Taner & Sezen (2009) applied Six Sigma DMAIC methodology to doctor turnover, using Pareto charts to identify the "vital few" root causes (burnout, salary) responsible for the majority of attrition.
4.  **Risk Management:** Bradford & Burrell (2025) used Ishikawa (fishbone) diagrams to diagnose root causes of nurse retention challenges, identifying aging workforce and burnout as systemic defects.

**Implications for Paper 1:**
These findings validate the framework's premise: workforce instability is a systemic failure mode that can be diagnosed via RCA. It supports treating "Workforce Agility" as a structural pillar rather than a soft HR metric.
