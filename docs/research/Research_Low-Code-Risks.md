# Research Question: What are the documented long-term maintenance and security risks of 'citizen developer' low-code applications in highly regulated healthcare environments?

**Motivation:** Paper 1 discusses the benefits of low-code platforms (speed, ROI) but needs to balance this with a discussion of the risks ("Cons") to provide a fair comparison with conversational AI.

**Key Findings (Scholar Labs 2026):**

1.  **Divergent Priorities & Security:** Citizen developers often prioritize new features over security, while IT analysts focus on leaks and malware (Simon, 2022). Hathnagoda (2024) identifies critical vulnerabilities in LCDPs including code injection, XSS, and insecure APIs, exacerbated by amateur developers.
2.  **Long-Term Viability & Architecture:** There is no replacement for trained developers for architecting solutions with long-term viability and scalability (Simon, 2022). LCNC platforms may lock users into proprietary ecosystems, complicating migration (Upadhyaya, 2023).
3.  **Technical Debt & Maintenance:**Novice developers risk technical debt accumulation requiring extensive maintenance later (Viljoen et al., 2024). Operational phase risks include turnover of citizen developers and automatic platform updates (Miyake et al., 2023).
4.  **Compliance Monitoring:** Healthcare compliance frameworks for low-code require ongoing monitoring of security controls and data integrity measures (Potharalanka, 2025).

**Implications for Paper 1:**
The discussion should contrast the rapid ROI of low-code with these long-term "hidden" costs. This strengthens the case for conversational AI as a potential "governed middle path" that provides agility without requiring domain experts to act as novice software architects.
