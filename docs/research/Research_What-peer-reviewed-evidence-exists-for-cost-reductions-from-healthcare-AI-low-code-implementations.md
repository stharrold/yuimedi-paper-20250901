# Research Question: What peer-reviewed (non-vendor-sponsored) evidence exists for cost reductions from healthcare AI/low-code implementations?

**Source:** Google Scholar Labs
**Date:** December 20, 2025
**Results Found:** 10 relevant papers

**Important Note:** Evidence found pertains primarily to **healthcare AI** implementations broadly (diagnostic AI, clinical decision support, administrative automation). **No specific peer-reviewed evidence was found for low-code platform implementations in healthcare.** This distinction is relevant for Paper 1's framework.

## Summary of Findings

Substantial peer-reviewed evidence exists documenting cost reductions from healthcare AI implementations, though methodological quality varies significantly. Multiple systematic reviews (2020-2025) report cost savings ranging from 10-40% across various applications including diagnostic imaging, clinical decision support, and administrative automation. Projected annual savings estimates range from $12.9 million (Medicaid) to $360 billion (US healthcare system). However, a critical 2020 JMIR systematic review found only 6 of 66 publications provided rigorous cost-effectiveness analysis, with none achieving methodologically complete cost impact assessment. Recent 2025 reviews show improvement in economic evaluation rigor.

## Key Themes and Observations

1. **Evidence Exists but Quality Varies:** Substantial peer-reviewed evidence documents healthcare AI cost savings, but methodological rigor varies significantly. The 2020 JMIR systematic review found severe methodological deficits in existing studies.

2. **Quantified Savings Range:** Documented savings range from 10-40% cost reductions for specific applications, with projected system-wide savings of $360 billion annually (US) if AI adoption becomes widespread.

3. **Specific Cost Categories:**
   - Diagnostic imaging and screening: Early detection reduces downstream costs
   - Administrative automation: 40% efficiency gains in claims processing/documentation
   - Clinical decision support: 10-20% cost reductions
   - Treatment optimization: 30%+ cost reductions in specific applications

4. **Recent Improvement (2025):** Multiple 2025 systematic reviews show growing evidence base with improved economic evaluation methodologies compared to 2020.

5. **Gap: No Low-Code Platform Evidence:** All evidence pertains to AI implementations broadly. No peer-reviewed studies specifically evaluated low-code or no-code platform implementations in healthcare contexts.

6. **Gap: Limited Long-term Studies:** Studies note shortage of prospective and long-term economic evaluations; most evidence is retrospective or modeled projections.

## Relevance to Three-Pillar Framework

| Pillar | Connection |
|--------|------------|
| **Analytics Maturity** | AI cost savings demonstrate value of advancing from reactive to predictive analytics; evidence supports investment case for analytics infrastructure |
| **Workforce Turnover** | Administrative automation (40% efficiency gains) could reduce burden on IT staff; however, no evidence directly links AI to reduced turnover |
| **Technical Barriers** | Evidence shows AI implementation costs (acquisition, integration, maintenance) are offset by savings, but barrier is methodology for rigorous ROI assessment |

## Important Limitation for Paper 1

The research question asked about both "healthcare AI" and "low-code platform implementations." Evidence was found only for healthcare AI. The lack of peer-reviewed evidence specifically for low-code platforms in healthcare represents a **literature gap** that should be acknowledged in Paper 1.
