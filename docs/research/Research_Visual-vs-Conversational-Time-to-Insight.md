# Research Question: How does the 'time-to-insight' for unanticipated clinical questions compare between pre-built visual dashboards and conversational analytics interfaces?

**Motivation:** Paper 1 compares conversational AI to other "Technical Enablement" tools. A key distinction is the ability to handle *unanticipated* questions (ad-hoc) versus *anticipated* ones (pre-built dashboards).

**Key Findings (Scholar Labs 2026):**

1.  **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Traditional dashboards focus on "exploitation" (monitoring known metrics), while autonomous analytics (conversational) increase the importance of "exploration" for unanticipated questions (Syed et al., *Advancing Self-Service BI*).
2.  **Efficiency in Crisis:** Conversational dashboards (CDB) significantly improve information-finding effectiveness during crisis response compared to traditional dashboards (Ruoff et al., 2023).
3.  **Complex Query Simplification:** Conversational interfaces simplify the expression of complex, nested queries and maintain context across independent queries (Dhamdhere et al., 2017).
4.  **Integrated Modality:** State-of-the-art systems (Samimi et al., 2025; Chowdhury et al., 2020) combine conversational and visual interfaces, allowing for fluid, iterative exploration that enhances both analytical reasoning and clinical workflow alignment.
5.  **Task Proficiency:** Chatbot users reach optimum proficiency after just one repetition, suggesting a lower training burden than complex BI dashboards (Holmes et al., 2019).

**Implications for Paper 1:**
The "Technical Enablement" pillar should categorize "Conversational Interfaces" as a mechanism for *high-agility* enablement (unanticipated queries) and "Integrated Dashboards" as the target state for *holistic* decision support.
