# Research Question: Does Shadow IT (Excel) provide agility benefits that formal systems miss, and can these be quantified?

**Motivation:** Paper 1 critiques Shadow IT as a governance failure. This research investigates the "Pros" (agility, timeliness) to understand why it persists as an alternative.

**Key Findings (Scholar Labs 2026):**

1.  **Value Addition:** All investigated shadow IT instances in a multiple case study added value to business workgroups, increasing productivity and flexibility (Zimmermann et al., 2017).
2.  **Timeliness vs. Backlog:** End-user computing (Excel) provides a major benefit in *timeliness*, circumventing the long waiting times and large backlogs of formal IS processes (Rivard, 1987).
3.  **Local Responsiveness:** "Business-managed IT" (balanced shadow IT) allows for local responsiveness to changing requirements while maintaining a link to global standardization (Kopper et al., 2020).
4.  **Agility Quantification:** Spreadsheet-based components allow for ongoing tracking of performance and profitability, though quantifying these benefits for formal justification remains difficult for managers (Coronado Mondragon et al., 2004).

**Implications for Paper 1:**
The paper should frame Shadow IT as an "Agility Shortcut" that fills gaps left by slow formal systems. Conversational AI competes by offering "Governed Agility"—matching the *speed* of Excel without the *silos* of Shadow IT.
