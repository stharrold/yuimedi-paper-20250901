# Research Question: Do modern 'headless' or AI-maintained semantic layers reduce 'schema rot' burden compared to traditional code-based layers in healthcare?

**Motivation:** Paper 1 critiques code-based semantic layers for suffering from "schema rot". This research investigates if newer architectures (Data Governance 4.0, Semantic Fabrics) have resolved this.

**Key Findings (Scholar Labs 2026):**

1.  **Data Governance 4.0:** Metadata-driven, agile, semi-automated frameworks using knowledge graphs can successfully integrate decades of clinical data (Oliveira et al., 2023).
2.  **Adaptive Data Quality:** AI-driven frameworks (Battula, 2025) reduce false-positive quality alerts by 40% under "schema drift" scenarios by using FHIR-aware semantic validation.
3.  **Semantic Fabrics:** Modern stacks (RDF, JSON-LD, SHACL) provide more flexible structures than conventional relational databases, with AI layers (LLMs/RAG) supporting intelligent automation (Sivaranjani et al., 2025).
4.  **System Evolution:** Lenz et al. (2007) argue that architectures must "conceptualize system evolution" because medical concepts are inherently volatile, making stable references for programmers elusive.
5.  **Efficiency Gains:** Semantic technologies result in "clean, structured and legible encoding" for quality measures, reducing the maintenance burden of SAS/SQL programs (Piro et al., 2016).

**Implications for Paper 1:**
The discussion should acknowledge that "Semantic Fabrics" are the advanced technological alternative to NL2SQL for *structural* enablement. While they reduce the rot burden, they require high *Analytics Maturity* (Pillar 1) to implement, reinforcing the framework's interconnections.
