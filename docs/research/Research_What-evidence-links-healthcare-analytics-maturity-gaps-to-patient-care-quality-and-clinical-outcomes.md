## Summary of Findings

Google Scholar Labs found 10 peer-reviewed papers (2019-2025) providing strong quantitative evidence linking healthcare analytics maturity gaps to patient care quality and clinical outcomes. The most significant findings come from HIMSS EMRAM-based studies showing hospitals with advanced digital maturity (levels 6-7) have 3.25x higher odds of achieving better Leapfrog safety grades, 1.8-2.24x higher odds of better patient experience ratings, and significantly reduced infection rates. Multiple studies confirm that analytics capability gaps lead to data-informed decision-making failures, increased clinical errors, and compromised patient care.

## Key Themes and Observations

1. **Quantified Maturity-Outcome Relationships:** HIMSS EMRAM studies provide strongest evidence - 3.25x higher odds of better safety grades, 1.8-2.24x higher odds of better patient experience for high-maturity hospitals

2. **BDA Capabilities and Quality:** Big data analytics capabilities, combined with organizational resources and analytical skills, improve readmission rates, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes (Wang 2019: 209 citations, Kamble 2019: 140 citations)

3. **Data Quality-Care Quality Link:** Poor-quality data (lower maturity indicator) directly linked to diagnostic errors, ineffective treatments, and compromised patient care (Gomes 2025)

## Relevance to Three-Pillar Framework

1. **Analytics maturity:** Direct evidence that analytics maturity gaps (measured by HIMSS EMRAM, BDA capability assessments) correlate with poorer patient outcomes - validates the analytics maturity pillar

2. **Workforce turnover:** Kacapor & Veselinovic (2024) explicitly link digital maturity gaps to workforce development needs; analytics capabilities require skilled personnel (Wang 2019)

3. **Technical barriers:** Multiple studies identify technical barriers (data governance gaps, poor data quality, non-intuitive systems) as maturity gaps directly impacting clinical outcomes

---

## Gaps Identified

- **Healthcare analytics-specific maturity models:** Most studies use digital/IT maturity (EMRAM); limited models specific to analytics maturity vs. broader digital maturity
- **Longitudinal studies:** Evidence is primarily cross-sectional; limited longitudinal studies tracking maturity improvements and outcome changes over time
- **Cost-outcome analysis:** Limited quantification of cost savings from maturity improvements alongside outcome improvements

---

## Suggested Follow-up Questions

**From Scholar Labs:**
1. Not provided

**Based on Literature Gaps:**
1. What longitudinal studies track healthcare analytics maturity improvements and corresponding outcome changes over time?
2. How do healthcare analytics-specific maturity models differ from broader digital maturity models like HIMSS EMRAM?
