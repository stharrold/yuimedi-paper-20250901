## Summary

Haven, the joint healthcare venture formed in 2018 by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase, disbanded in February 2021 after just three years. The literature identifies multiple contributing factors: leadership loss, data sharing difficulties between founding companies, small organizational scale, lack of price transparency in healthcare, COVID-19 disruption, and inability to agree on a unified operating approach.

## Key Findings

### Primary Causes of Dissolution

1. **Leadership Loss:** The venture lost its CEO (Atul Gawande) and five other senior executives, destabilizing organizational continuity (Pellegrin 2021).

2. **Data Sharing Barriers:** Even the three founding companies could not effectively share health-care cost data with each other, hindering the core mission of aggregating information to lower costs (Acchiardo & Gunderman 2021; Bean 2021).

3. **Limited Scale:** Haven never employed more than 75 people, limiting its ability to effect industry-wide change (Acchiardo & Gunderman 2021).

4. **Lack of Healthcare Price Transparency:** The venture struggled against systemic opacity in healthcare pricing that has defeated previous reform efforts (Bean 2021).

5. **Operating Disagreements:** The three founding companies could not agree on a unified operating approach (Chaganti 2023).

6. **COVID-19 Pandemic:** The pandemic and inflexibility of the modern insurance market may have accelerated the collapse (Bedoya Reina et al. 2021).

### Broader Context

Warren Buffett acknowledged that reducing healthcare costs proved more challenging than expected despite the combined resources of three Fortune 500 companies (Pellegrin 2024). This failure reflects the significant structural challenges in the healthcare industry, including:

- Legal obstacles preventing coordination (fee-for-service payment structures)
- Regulatory barriers to disruptive innovation
- Fragmentation of the US healthcare system (Elhauge 2010)

## Relevance to Paper 1

This research directly supports Section 4.1 (Analytics Maturity) of the three-pillar framework by demonstrating that even well-resourced attempts to standardize healthcare analytics face systemic barriers:

1. **Data sharing barriers** exemplify why healthcare organizations struggle to achieve analytics maturity (Pillar 1)
2. **Leadership turnover** illustrates knowledge loss challenges (Pillar 2)
3. **Technical/regulatory complexity** demonstrates barriers to technical innovation (Pillar 3)

The Haven case provides a high-profile example of how the three pillars interact: data fragmentation prevented analytics maturity, leadership loss disrupted institutional knowledge, and regulatory complexity created technical barriers.
