# Research: Passive vs. Active Knowledge Capture Sustainability

**Question:** How does the 'passive capture' of a Knowledge Repository (where users must stop working to document) compare to the 'active capture' of a conversational interface (where the query itself is the documentation) regarding long-term sustainability?

**Scope:** Paper1 (Analytical Framework)

## Key Findings

Research highlights significant trade-offs between "passive" documentation (manual repositories) and "active" documentation (conversational/interactive capture) regarding accuracy, participation, and long-term maintenance.

1.  **Impact on Participation:** Whittaker et al. (2008, 75 citations) found that manual note-taking (passive capture) negatively impacts active participation in the primary conversation/task. Users struggle to process new information while documenting, leading to inaccurate or unintelligible records.
2.  **Long-term Utility:** Traditional passive capture artifacts (notes, sketches) are often limited in usefulness because they are treated as byproducts rather than intentional, lasting outputs. Active capture technologies (e.g., real-time interaction analysis) focus on the *process activity*, making the documentation more representative of the actual work (Moore et al., 2018).
3.  **Cognitive Involvement:** Interactive environments promote deeper cognitive involvement and improved learning outcomes, which supports long-term knowledge retention—a key component of sustainability (Talebi & Safaei, 2022).
4.  **Maintenance Burden:** While active capture (e.g., conversational interfaces) enhances engagement and data quality, it is resource-intensive to develop and maintain. This suggests that the "active" approach has higher technical sustainability requirements despite its superior documentation quality (Talebi & Safaei, 2022).
