## Key Findings

Academic research strongly supports the role of structural and procedural standardization as a "buffer" or "ratchet" mechanism that preserves organizational memory during personnel turnover.

1.  **Buffering Turnover Effects:** Rao & Argote (2006, 191 citations) empirically demonstrate that knowledge embedded in organizational structures—specifically specialized roles and routines—buffers the organization from the disruptive effects of employee turnover. Turnover impacts the performance of organizations with high procedural structure significantly less than those with low structure.
2.  **Standardization as a Retention Facility:** Hong (2025) finds that task standardization serves as an important retention facility for organizational memory. By standardizing routines, organizations mitigate the loss of knowledge that typically occurs when voluntary or managerial turnover happens.
3.  **Mitigating Delays:** Evidence shows that increasing the share of highly standardized projects moderates the impact of turnover on project delays (Hong, 2025). This supports the "ratchet" concept: once a process is documented as "Standard Work," it provides a baseline that prevents the organization from "slipping" backward when key individuals leave.
4.  **Transfer Mechanism:** Structuring work activities functions as a mechanism for both retaining knowledge over time and facilitating its transfer to new members (Rao & Argote, 2006).
