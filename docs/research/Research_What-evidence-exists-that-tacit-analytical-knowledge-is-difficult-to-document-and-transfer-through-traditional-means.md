## Summary of Findings

Google Scholar Labs found 10 peer-reviewed papers (2005-2022) providing strong empirical and theoretical evidence that tacit analytical knowledge is inherently difficult to document and transfer through traditional means. The evidence spans multiple domains including nuclear power, new product development, R&D, manufacturing, and safety-critical systems. Key findings include: (1) tacit knowledge is deeply rooted in personal experience and context, making formalization difficult; (2) written reports and databases fail to capture critical learning; (3) experts often lack skills, motivation, or time to document their expertise; and (4) even when documentation is attempted, essential aspects are lost due to lack of shared experience between experts and novices.

## 1. Tacit knowledge, lessons learnt, and new product development

**Authors:** K Goffin, U Koners
**Publication:** Journal of Product Innovation Management (Wiley), 2011
**Citations:** 531
**Link:** https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15405885
**PDF:** https://www.academia.edu

**Abstract/Summary:**
Explains that much of the knowledge generated during new product development (NPD) is tacit, making it difficult to express, connected with problem solving, and dependent on team interactions.

**Methodology/Approach:** Empirical case studies

**Key Points:**
- **Lack of Documentation:** Empirical evidence from case studies showing that learning related to tacit knowledge was often not captured for dissemination in formal post-project review reports
- **Transfer Mechanisms:** Transferring key NPD knowledge requires methods like mentoring and encouraging the use of metaphors and stories, rather than traditional documentation
- **Expression Difficulty:** Tacit knowledge is connected with problem solving and dependent on team interactions, making it difficult to express explicitly

**Relationship to Other Papers:** Most cited paper in results (531 citations); provides foundational evidence that Goffin & Koners (2010) builds upon with German company research

## 2. Tacit knowledge transfer and the knowledge disconnect

**Authors:** T Foos, G Schum, S Rothenberg
**Publication:** Journal of Knowledge Management (Emerald), 2006
**Citations:** 386
**Link:** https://www.emerald.com/insight/publication/issn/1367-3270
**PDF:** https://www.researchgate.net

**Abstract/Summary:**
Explains that tacit knowledge, by its nature, is difficult to formalize and transfer using conventional mechanisms such as documents, blueprints, and procedures because it is not easily codified.

**Methodology/Approach:** Empirical study of project teams

**Key Points:**
- **Understanding Tacit Transfer:** Subject of tacit knowledge transfer, including its content and process, is poorly understood among managers and project leaders, despite them seeing its value
- **Managing Tacit Integration:** Lack of processes exists to help project teams distinguish between complex, tacit knowledge and technology transfer, indicating difficulty in managing its integration
- **Conventional Mechanisms Fail:** Documents, blueprints, and procedures are ineffective because tacit knowledge is not easily codified

**Relationship to Other Papers:** Second most cited (386 citations); cited by Fetterhoff et al. (2011) on accessing internal knowledge

## 3. The "soft" dimension of organizational knowledge transfer

**Authors:** GAC Guzman, J Wilson
**Publication:** Journal of Knowledge Management (Emerald), 2005
**Citations:** 160
**Link:** https://www.emerald.com/insight/publication/issn/1367-3270
**PDF:** https://www.academia.edu

**Abstract/Summary:**
Explains that organizational knowledge, when abstract and possessing "soft" features, is related to implicit, embedded, and invisible knowledge, presumptions, values, and ways of thinking that permeate behavior.

**Methodology/Approach:** Theoretical analysis with factory case examples

**Key Points:**
- **Tacit Knowledge Complexity:** Complex organizational capabilities, developed over time, are largely tacit and supported by macro, micro, and institutional forces that are themselves difficult to transfer
- **Practice-Based Knowledge:** Factory know-how is often not contained in manuals but is instead found in practice and experience, demanding a high degree of tacit knowledge to perform specific tasks
- **Context Dependency:** Organizational knowledge is only meaningful when tied to specific situations, making templates ill-defined and context-dependent for transfer

**Relationship to Other Papers:** Provides theoretical foundation for empirical studies by Goffin et al. and others

## 4. Managing lessons learned and tacit knowledge in new product development

**Authors:** K Goffin, U Koners, D Baxter
**Publication:** Research-Technology Management (Taylor & Francis), 2010
**Citations:** 159
**Link:** https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/urtm20/current
**PDF:** Not available

**Abstract/Summary:**
Presents empirical evidence from research at five German companies, showing that written reports fail to convey much of the key learning from New Product Development (NPD) teams.

**Methodology/Approach:** Multi-company empirical research (5 German companies)

**Key Points:**
- **Tacit Knowledge Difficult to Share:** Much of the knowledge generated in complex NPD projects is tacit, making it difficult to express and share, necessitating specific steps to promote its transfer
- **Databases Lose Learning:** Use of databases to capture and transfer lessons learned from Post-Project Reviews (PPRs) results in the loss of much of the key learning generated by NPD teams
- **Written Reports Fail:** Written reports fail to convey much of the key learning from teams

**Relationship to Other Papers:** Builds on Goffin & Koners (2011); provides specific evidence on database inadequacy

**Abstract/Summary:**
Explains that tacit knowledge, often found in R&D and innovation environments, is deeper, richer, and more complex, making it difficult to articulate or codify compared to explicit, codified knowledge.

**Methodology/Approach:** Organizational research study

**Key Points:**
- **Lack of Shared Understanding:** Complex, tacit knowledge is hard to transfer or codify due to differences in perspectives and a lack of shared understanding among individuals
- **Difficulty of Accessing Tacit Knowledge:** Tacit knowledge is fundamentally more difficult to access than explicit or procedural knowledge
- **R&D Context:** Tacit knowledge in R&D and innovation environments is deeper, richer, and more complex than explicit knowledge

**Relationship to Other Papers:** Focuses on R&D context; complements manufacturing focus of other papers

## 7. The role of tacit knowledge and the challenges in transferring it: a case study at the Finnish NPPs

**Authors:** L Hyttinen, N Rintala
**Publication:** International Journal of Nuclear Knowledge Management, 2005
**Citations:** 11
**Link:** https://www.inderscienceonline.com/journal/ijnkm
**PDF:** Not available

**Abstract/Summary:**
Explores the challenges in transferring tacit knowledge at two Finnish nuclear power plants through an empirical study, demonstrating that this undocumented knowledge is crucial for safety and effective operation.

**Methodology/Approach:** Empirical case study (2 Finnish nuclear power plants)

**Key Points:**
- **Tacit Knowledge Definition:** Explicit knowledge is articulable and documentable, contrasting with tacit knowledge which is difficult to perceive and articulate, leading to challenges in its documentation and transfer
- **Documentation Barriers:** Experts often lack the skills, motivation, and time to document their expertise; even when documentation is attempted (sometimes with technical writers), essential aspects of the expertise may not be successfully transferred
- **Safety-Critical Context:** Undocumented tacit knowledge is crucial for safety and effective operation in nuclear power plants

**Relationship to Other Papers:** Part of Finnish nuclear power research with Rintala & Hyttinen (2006); provides safety-critical domain evidence

## 8. Methods for sharing tacit nuclear knowledge and expertise

**Authors:** N Rintala, L Hyttinen
**Publication:** International Journal of Nuclear Knowledge Management, 2006
**Citations:** 9
**Link:** https://www.inderscienceonline.com/journal/ijnkm
**PDF:** Not available

**Abstract/Summary:**
Explains that challenges specifically lie in transferring tacit knowledge, which experts accumulate over long careers and diverse professional experiences, especially within the nuclear and power industries.

**Methodology/Approach:** Empirical study in nuclear industry

**Key Points:**
- **Difficulty of Formalization:** Tacit knowledge is deeply rooted in a person's mental and physical experiences, making it difficult to formalize and communicate through traditional means, contrasting it with codified, explicit knowledge
- **Documentation Obstacles:** Although experienced workers documented their tacit knowledge, obstacles existed in externalizing it and sharing it explicitly because experts viewed their knowledge as self-evident and novices struggled to understand the documents due to lack of shared experience
- **Long Career Accumulation:** Tacit knowledge accumulates over long careers and diverse professional experiences

**Relationship to Other Papers:** Companion paper to Hyttinen & Rintala (2005); identifies expert-novice communication gap

## 9. Assessing non-technical methods for transferring tacit knowledge in safety-critical systems: A study on maritime pilot training

**Authors:** R Eklund, AL Osvalder
**Publication:** INTED2022 Proceedings, 2022
**Citations:** 2
**Link:** https://library.iated.org
**PDF:** Not available

**Abstract/Summary:**
Explains that tacit knowledge, also referred to as know-how or skill, is difficult to verbalize or transform into written text, making it not readily available for others.

**Methodology/Approach:** Empirical study of maritime pilot training

**Key Points:**
- **Transfer Methods by Knowledge Type:** Explicit knowledge is easily transferred through technical means like manuals, instructions, and databases; implicit knowledge requires non-technical methods such as mentorship and on-the-job experience where knowledge remains non-codified
- **Undocumented Social Transfer:** Substantial amount of tacit knowledge transfer occurs during on-the-job and social activities, but methods for transferring this knowledge in social settings are not clearly documented or utilized in the organization
- **Verbalization Difficulty:** Tacit knowledge (know-how or skill) is difficult to verbalize or transform into written text

**Relationship to Other Papers:** Extends tacit knowledge research to maritime safety-critical domain; complements nuclear industry studies

## 10. Tacit Knowledge Transfer in Safety-Critical Systems: A Systematic Literature Review

**Authors:** R Eklund, AL Osvalder
**Publication:** Available at SSRN 4901777, 2024
**Citations:** Not yet cited (recent publication)
**Link:** https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4901777
**PDF:** https://papers.ssrn.com

**Abstract/Summary:**
Explains that tacit knowledge, accumulated through long-term employment in areas like operational safety and managing non-normal situations, is often unspoken, experience-based, and difficult to document.

**Methodology/Approach:** Systematic literature review

**Key Points:**
- **Undocumented Transfer Methods:** Transfer of tacit knowledge, which may take several years, is seldom documented, even in methods commonly employed like apprenticeships
- **Inconsistent Definitions:** Inconsistencies in the definition and operationalization of tacit knowledge complicate the design of research instruments and the study of its transfer
- **Long-term Employment Required:** Tacit knowledge accumulated through long-term employment in areas like operational safety and managing non-normal situations

**Relationship to Other Papers:** Systematic review synthesizing findings from multiple studies; provides meta-level evidence

## Key Themes and Observations

1. **Fundamental Formalization Difficulty:** Multiple studies confirm tacit knowledge is deeply rooted in personal experience, context, and practice, making it inherently resistant to formalization (Foos 2006: 386 citations, Guzman 2005: 160 citations)

2. **Documentation System Failures:** Databases, written reports, and post-project reviews consistently fail to capture tacit knowledge (Goffin 2010: databases "lose learning"; Goffin 2011: learning "not captured" in formal reports)

3. **Expert-Novice Communication Gap:** Experts view their knowledge as self-evident while novices lack shared experience to understand documentation attempts (Rintala 2006)

4. **Expert Barriers:** Experts often lack skills, motivation, or time to document their expertise; even with technical writers, essential aspects are lost (Hyttinen 2005)

5. **Alternative Transfer Methods Required:** Mentoring, storytelling, metaphors, on-the-job experience, and social activities are more effective than traditional documentation (Goffin 2011, Eklund 2022)

6. **Safety-Critical Implications:** In nuclear and maritime domains, undocumented tacit knowledge is crucial for safety and effective operation, making documentation failures particularly concerning

## Relevance to Three-Pillar Framework

1. **Analytics maturity:** Tacit analytical knowledge (query patterns, data interpretation expertise, domain-specific SQL idioms) resists documentation, limiting organizations' ability to advance analytics maturity through traditional knowledge management approaches

2. **Workforce turnover:** When experienced analysts leave, their tacit knowledge about data structures, query optimization, and domain-specific patterns cannot be captured in documentation, resulting in institutional memory loss that cannot be recovered through traditional means

3. **Technical barriers:** NL-to-SQL systems may help preserve tacit query knowledge by encoding expert patterns into reusable natural language interfaces, potentially mitigating documentation failures identified in this literature

---

## Gaps Identified

- **Healthcare-specific evidence:** Most studies focus on NPD, nuclear, manufacturing, and maritime domains; limited healthcare analytics-specific research on tacit knowledge transfer
- **Quantified knowledge loss:** Studies describe qualitative documentation failures but rarely quantify the percentage of tacit knowledge lost through traditional means
- **Technology-mediated solutions:** Limited research on whether AI/NL interfaces can capture tacit analytical knowledge more effectively than traditional documentation

---

## Suggested Follow-up Questions

**From Scholar Labs:**
