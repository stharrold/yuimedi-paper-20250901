## Key Themes and Observations

1. **Gold Standard Comparison:** The predominant validation approach involves comparing discovered relationships against a manually curated "gold standard" or database schema constraints. This is used in papers 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8.

2. **Human Expert Evaluation:** Several papers (7, 9, 10) validate by comparing machine-discovered matchings against correct matchings written by human experts, particularly for schema matching tasks.

3. **F-Measure as Primary Metric:** Nearly all papers use the F-measure (harmonic mean of precision and recall) as the primary evaluation metric, enabling fair comparison across different approaches.

4. **Machine Learning Approaches:** Multiple papers (2, 3, 8) employ machine learning classifiers with cross-validation for robust evaluation of relationship discovery accuracy.

5. **Precision-Recall Tradeoffs:** Papers 5 and 6 explicitly discuss the tradeoffs between precision and recall, often controllable through parameters like alpha values or top-X% thresholds.
