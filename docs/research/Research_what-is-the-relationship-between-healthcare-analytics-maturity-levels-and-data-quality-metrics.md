2. **Explicit Maturity-DQ Dimensions:** Multiple frameworks (DAMAF, HDQM2, HAAM) explicitly incorporate data quality as a measurable dimension within maturity assessments

3. **Bidirectional Relationship:** Higher maturity enables better data governance → better DQ → enables further maturity advancement (virtuous cycle)

4. **Healthcare-Specific Frameworks:** The literature emphasizes that healthcare requires specialized DQ frameworks with dimensions absent from general frameworks

5. **HIMSS Integration:** Several papers reference HIMSS models (EMRAM, AMAM) as complementary to data quality maturity assessments

## Relevance to Three-Pillar Framework

1. **Analytics maturity:** **Directly relevant.** This research establishes that data quality is both a prerequisite and a dimension of analytics maturity. Organizations at low maturity stages consistently struggle with data quality issues that prevent advancement.

2. **Workforce turnover:** **Indirectly relevant.** Data governance and data quality management require institutional knowledge. High turnover could disrupt DQ initiatives and prevent maturity advancement. The need for "data literacy" (Gomes & Romão 2018) implies workforce capability requirements.

3. **Technical barriers:** **Moderately relevant.** Poor data quality (inconsistent, unstandardized, unstructured EHR data) is identified as a technical barrier preventing advanced analytics implementation. NL2SQL systems would face similar data quality challenges.

---

## Gaps Identified

1. **Quantitative Metrics:** While frameworks describe maturity-DQ relationships conceptually, few papers provide specific quantitative metrics correlating maturity stage advancement with measurable DQ improvements.

2. **AMAM-Specific DQ Studies:** Limited research specifically examining how HIMSS AMAM stages correlate with data quality metrics (most studies use EMRAM or custom frameworks).

3. **Intervention Studies:** No randomized trials or quasi-experimental studies measuring DQ improvement from maturity model adoption.

---

## Suggested Follow-up Questions

**From Scholar Labs:**
1. What specific data quality metrics improve as organizations advance through HIMSS AMAM stages?
2. How do healthcare organizations measure data quality improvement from maturity model adoption?
3. What interventions most effectively address data quality barriers in healthcare analytics maturity advancement?

**Based on Literature Gaps:**
1. What is the quantitative relationship between specific DQ metrics and maturity stage progression?
2. How does HIMSS AMAM incorporate data quality assessment differently from EMRAM?
