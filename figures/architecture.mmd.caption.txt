Healthcare Analytics Architecture. Solid lines indicate the primary data flow from clinical user natural language queries through a conversational AI interface to a healthcare NLP engine for context-aware SQL generation. Bi-directional arrows at steps 5 and 8 represent the iterative 'Query & Refine' loop where users refine their intent based on delivered insights. The critical validation step (dotted bi-directional line) shows domain experts confirming or correcting generated SQL before results are trusted. Validated NL-SQL-Rationale triples flow to organizational memory (dashed line), where they persist independent of staff tenure and inform future query generation.
