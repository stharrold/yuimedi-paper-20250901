## Aims and scope
npj Digital Medicine considers research that explores all aspects of digital medicine including the clinical application and implementation of digital and mobile technologies, virtual healthcare, and innovative applications of artificial intelligence and informatics. The journal aims to guide the transformation of health and healthcare through the incorporation of novel digital and mobile technologies. The journal covers a broad range of topics including but not limited to:

- Clinical application and efficacy of novel mobile applications, monitors, sensors, software, and wearables
- Clinical application of novel and validated artificial intelligence and machine learning models
- Clinical informatics and digital transformation of clinical practice
- Clinical trials testing the efficacy and interoperability of digital tools and devices
- Digital medicine ethics, governance, policy, regulation, and security
- Digital twins
- Validated digital biomarkers
- Virtual models of care

The journal typically does not consider clinical research using off-the-shelf digital tools and artificial intelligence models, pre-clinical basic science studies, purely observational studies, case studies, and small-scale preliminary studies. The journal offers more choice to Nature Portfolio authors who are seeking a fully open-access and more inclusive platform for publishing their work. The journal is led by digital health experts who collaborate to cultivate high-quality research. As part of the npj Series, this journal focuses on fostering global partnerships with the research community and other Springer Nature journals.

## Content types

On this page: Article | Brief Communication | Comment | Editorial | Matters Arising | News and Views | Perspective | Review

The npj Series publishes a range of content types. We do not impose strict limits on word count or page numbers as the journals are online only and fully Open Access. However, we strongly recommend that you write concisely and follow the below formatting guidelines for the different content types published by our journals.

All submissions should be accompanied by:
- A cover letter
- An English language manuscript file formatted to the desired content type, provided in an editable format
- Figures and optional Supplementary Information files and any relevant reporting checklists. Supplementary Information should be combined and supplied as a single, separate file, preferably in PDF format.

Please see the journal's submission guidelines for detailed information, including how to format and submit Tables, Figures, and Supplementary Information.

### Article
Articles should report substantial original primary research. Articles include received and accepted dates and are peer reviewed. Please note that systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and meta-analyses should be submitted as Articles, not Reviews.

### Brief Communication
Brief Communications report a concise study of high quality and broad interest that do not fulfill the criteria of a full research article. Brief Communications include received and accepted dates and are peer reviewed.

### Comment
Comments have a very flexible format and may cover policy, science and society, or purely scientific issues. The main criteria are that they should be of immediate interest to a broad readership and be written in an accessible, non-technical style. Comments include received and accepted dates and are typically peer reviewed.

### Editorial
Editorials are typically written by the senior editorial team of the journal, under the direction of the Editor-in-Chief. Unsolicited Editorials will not be considered. Editorials include received and accepted dates and are not typically peer reviewed, although they can be at the discretion of the editorial team.

### Matters Arising
Matters Arising serve as important scientific comments and clarifications on peer-reviewed articles published in the journal and aim to facilitate post-publication commentary. They may highlight challenges, clarifications, or in some cases, replication of the published work. They are usually published alongside a Reply from the original authors and are bidirectionally linked with the original published paper.

### News and Views
News and Views inform readers about the latest advances in the field, as reported in recently published papers, scientific meetings, or in response to policy or regulatory changes. They are by prior arrangement only with the journal's Editorial Team.

### Perspective
Perspectives provide a forum for authors to discuss evidence-based opinions, models, and ideas. They are more forward-looking and/or speculative than Review articles and may take a narrower field of view. They may be opinionated but should remain balanced and are intended to stimulate discussion and new experimental approaches. Perspectives include received and accepted dates and are peer reviewed.

### Review
Reviews narratively summarize recent advances in the scientific literature within a given research field. Although Reviews should be recognized as scholarly by specialists in the field, they should be written to inform non-specialist readers. Reviews should be presented using simple prose, avoiding excessive jargon and technical detail. Reviews include received and accepted dates and are peer reviewed.
