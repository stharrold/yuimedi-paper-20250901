<hr />
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am pleased to submit the manuscript titled <strong>“Healthcare
Analytics Challenges: A Three-Pillar Framework Connecting Analytics
Maturity, Workforce Agility, and Technical Enablement”</strong> for
consideration as a Review article in JMIR Medical Informatics.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-significance">Background and Significance</h2>
<p>Healthcare organizations face three interconnected challenges that
create a compounding cycle threatening data-driven transformation: low
analytics maturity (only 39 organizations globally have achieved HIMSS
AMAM Stage 6-7), systemic workforce instability, and technical barriers
in natural language to SQL generation. This review identifies a critical
gap in the literature: while single-domain studies exist for each
challenge, few analyze how they interconnect to create institutional
memory loss.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>This narrative review synthesizes peer-reviewed studies and industry
reports from Crossref, PubMed, arXiv, and Semantic Scholar. Grey
literature sources were assessed using the AACODS checklist. Evidence
was integrated through an original three-pillar analytical framework
examining how these challenges interconnect and compound each other.</p>
<h2 id="principal-findings">Principal Findings</h2>
<p>The review contributes an original three-pillar analytical framework
revealing a self-reinforcing cycle: (1) <strong>Analytics
Maturity</strong>: Low maturity leaves clinical decisions unsupported,
correlating with higher turnover; (2) <strong>Workforce Impact</strong>:
Turnover (~34% implied annual rate) causes institutional memory loss
that further degrades capabilities; and (3) <strong>Technical
Enablement</strong>: Technical barriers prevent the capture of this
knowledge, blocking recovery. The review also identifies
<strong>Governance Necessity</strong> as a critical finding, arguing
that democratization through NL2SQL requires stricter governance
(“Golden Queries”) to move from ad-hoc reporting to trusted AI
deployment.</p>
