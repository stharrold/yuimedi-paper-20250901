# Cover Letter for JMIR Medical Informatics Submission

**Date:** January 2026

**To:** Editor-in-Chief, JMIR Medical Informatics

**Re:** Manuscript Submission - Review Article

---

Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit the manuscript titled **"Healthcare Analytics Challenges: A Three-Pillar Framework Connecting Analytics Maturity, Workforce Dynamics, and Technical Barriers"** for consideration as a Review article in JMIR Medical Informatics.

## Background and Significance

Healthcare organizations face three interconnected challenges that create a compounding cycle threatening data-driven transformation: low analytics maturity (only 39 organizations globally have achieved HIMSS AMAM Stage 6-7), systemic workforce instability, and technical barriers in natural language to SQL generation. This review identifies a critical "blind spot" in the literature regarding longitudinal tenure data for healthcare informatics professionals, suggesting that the lack of modern metrics obscures the true severity of institutional memory decay.

## Methodology

This narrative review synthesizes peer-reviewed studies and industry reports from Crossref, PubMed, arXiv, and Semantic Scholar. Grey literature sources were assessed using the AACODS checklist. Evidence was integrated through an original three-pillar analytical framework examining how these challenges interconnect and compound each other.

## Principal Findings

The review contributes: (1) an original three-pillar analytical framework revealing how low maturity accelerates turnover, turnover degrades maturity, and technical barriers prevent recovery; (2) a resolution to the "validator paradox" by reframing validation as informatics "standard work" and an "organizational knowledge ratchet"; (3) a comparative analysis of knowledge preservation strategies contrasting conversational AI against code-based semantic layers and passive documentation; and (4) the positioning of NL2SQL as a "Governance Forcing Function" that compels the codification of tacit business rules.

## Conflicts of Interest

The author declares competing interests: Samuel T Harrold is a contract product advisor at Yuimedi, Inc., which develops healthcare analytics software, and is employed as a Data Scientist at Indiana University Health. This paper presents an analytical framework derived from published literature and does not evaluate or recommend specific commercial products.
