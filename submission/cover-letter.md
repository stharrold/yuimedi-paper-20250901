Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit the manuscript titled **"Healthcare Analytics Challenges: A Three-Pillar Framework Connecting Analytics Maturity, Workforce Agility, and Technical Enablement"** for consideration as a Review article in JMIR Medical Informatics. The manuscript consists of 2,348 words (main text) and includes 139 verified citations.

## Manuscript Statistics

- **Total Citations:** 139 verified references
- **Illustrations:** 3 figures (PRISMA flow, System Architecture, and Validated Query Cycle)

## Background and Significance

Healthcare organizations face three interconnected challenges that create a compounding cycle threatening data-driven transformation: low analytics maturity (only 39 organizations globally have achieved HIMSS AMAM Stage 6-7), systemic workforce instability (53% CIO turnover within three years), and technical barriers in natural language to SQL generation. This review identifies a critical gap in the literature: while single-domain studies exist for each challenge, few analyze how they interconnect to create institutional memory loss.

## Methodology

This narrative review synthesizes evidence across clinical informatics, human resources, and natural language processing. We identified literature from Crossref, PubMed, arXiv, and Semantic Scholar (n=570), with a final corpus of 135 sources. Grey literature was assessed using the AACODS checklist to ensure rigor. Evidence was integrated through an original three-pillar analytical framework examining how these challenges interconnect and compound each other.

## Principal Findings

The review contributes an original three-pillar analytical framework revealing a self-reinforcing cycle: (1) **Analytics Maturity**: Low maturity traps organizations in reactive cycles; (2) **Workforce Agility**: Turnover exceeds other sectors, causing loss of "tacit knowledge"; and (3) **Technical Enablement**: Technical barriers block the capture of expertise. We illustrate how this cycle can be broken through a **Validated Query Cycle**, a governance forcing function that transforms analytical logic into durable software assets, ensuring institutional memory persists independent of staff tenure.
