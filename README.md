## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains research documentation for YuiQuery, a conversational AI platform for healthcare analytics that addresses three key challenges:

1. **Low Healthcare Analytics Maturity**: Enabling non-technical healthcare professionals to perform complex data analysis
2. **Healthcare Workforce Turnover**: Preserving institutional memory and analytical capabilities
3. **Technical Barriers**: Bridging the gap between natural language queries and SQL database operations
