## Section 1: Study Information

### Title

Three-Pillar Analytical Framework for Healthcare Analytics: A Narrative Review of Natural Language to SQL, Analytics Maturity, and Workforce Turnover

### Authors

Samuel T Harrold (Indiana University Health; Yuimedi Corp.)

### Description

This narrative review synthesizes evidence from three research domains (natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) generation, healthcare analytics maturity, and workforce turnover) to develop a novel analytical framework for understanding healthcare analytics challenges. The primary contribution is the "three-pillar framework" that reveals interconnections between technical, organizational, and workforce dimensions of healthcare analytics.

### Hypotheses/Research Questions

**Note:** These research questions emerged iteratively during the review process rather than being specified a priori.

1. What is the current state of natural language to SQL technology as applied to healthcare data?
2. How do healthcare organizations compare to industry benchmarks for analytics maturity?
3. What is the relationship between workforce turnover and institutional knowledge preservation in healthcare analytics?
4. Can these three domains be synthesized into a unified analytical framework?

## Section 2: Design Plan

### Study Type

Narrative literature review (NOT a systematic review with meta-analysis)

### Blinding

Not applicable (single-author narrative review)

### Study Design

**Design:** Non-registered narrative review with post-hoc documentation
**Analysis approach:** Qualitative thematic synthesis
**Framework development:** Inductive, emerging from iterative literature review

## Section 3: Sampling Plan

### Existing Data

This registration is being submitted AFTER data collection and analysis are complete.

### Data Collection Procedures

Literature was collected from:
- PubMed/MEDLINE
- IEEE Xplore
- ACM Digital Library
- arXiv (cs.CL, cs.DB)
- Google Scholar
- Industry sources (HIMSS, professional associations, market research)

**Date range:** 2004-2024 (emphasis on 2015-2024)

### Sample Size

Final corpus: 41 sources (30 academic, 11 industry/grey literature)

### Sample Size Rationale

Sample size was determined by thematic saturation: continued searching yielded diminishing returns of novel information relevant to the three-pillar framework.

## Section 4: Variables

### Measured Variables

Not applicable (qualitative narrative review)

### Indices

Not applicable

---

## Section 5: Analysis Plan

### Statistical Models

Not applicable (no quantitative meta-analysis performed)

### Transformations

Not applicable

### Inference Criteria

Framework validity assessed through:
- Internal consistency across literature themes
- Alignment with established models (HIMSS AMAM, DIKW hierarchy)
- Coverage of relevant literature without significant gaps

### Data Exclusion

Sources excluded if:
- No verifiable DOI, URL, or institutional attribution
- Vendor marketing materials without independent validation
- Preprints without peer review (exception: foundational NL2SQL benchmarks)
- Sources with unverifiable statistics or methodological concerns

### Missing Data

Not applicable

### Exploratory Analysis

**Note:** All analysis in this narrative review is exploratory. The three-pillar framework emerged inductively rather than being tested against pre-specified hypotheses.

## Section 6: Other

### Other

**Deviations from standard systematic review methodology:**

This is explicitly a narrative review, not a systematic review. Key methodological differences from systematic review standards:

1. **No PROSPERO registration:** Not registered prior to conducting the review
2. **Single coder:** Literature screening and synthesis performed by single author
3. **No meta-analysis:** Qualitative synthesis only
4. **Post-hoc criteria:** Inclusion/exclusion criteria refined during review process
5. **No PRISMA compliance:** This is not a systematic review, so PRISMA guidelines are not applicable (see docs/prisma-assessment.md for detailed assessment)

These limitations are acknowledged in the manuscript's Methodological Limitations section.
