## Section 1: Framework Validity

### 1.1 Pillar Independence and Coherence

- [ ] **Pillar 1 (Analytics Maturity)** is clearly defined and distinguishable from other pillars
- [ ] **Pillar 2 (Workforce Dynamics)** is clearly defined and distinguishable from other pillars
- [ ] **Pillar 3 (Technical Barriers)** is clearly defined and distinguishable from other pillars
- [ ] The three pillars represent orthogonal dimensions (not overlapping constructs)
- [ ] The framework addresses a gap not covered by existing models (HIMSS AMAM, DIKW)

**Comments:**


### 1.2 Framework Development Documentation

- [ ] The Framework Development section adequately explains how the framework emerged from literature review
- [ ] The development process is reproducible (another researcher could follow the methodology)
- [ ] Theoretical grounding (Table 3) accurately maps pillars to established models
- [ ] Framework limitations are honestly acknowledged

**Comments:**

## Section 2: Evidence Quality

### 2.1 Citation Appropriateness

- [ ] Academic citations [A1-A30] are from peer-reviewed venues
- [ ] Industry citations [I1-I11] are from authoritative sources (not marketing materials)
- [ ] Citation density is appropriate (not over- or under-cited)
- [ ] Citations support the claims they are used for

**Comments:**


### 2.2 Grey Literature Justification

- [ ] Use of industry sources is justified for topics where academic literature is insufficient
- [ ] AACODS quality assessment (Table 1) is appropriately applied
- [ ] Vendor-sponsored research (e.g., Forrester [I5]) is appropriately caveated
- [ ] Grey literature sources are not over-weighted in conclusions

**Comments:**


### 2.3 Statistical Claims

- [ ] The [A10] turnover statistic (34%, 2004) is appropriately qualified as dated
- [ ] Alternative/contemporary data sources are cited where available [I11]
- [ ] Quantitative claims include confidence intervals or ranges where appropriate
- [ ] Market projections (e.g., [I7]) are attributed and caveated

**Comments:**

## Section 3: Methodology

### 3.1 Search Strategy Documentation

- [ ] Search strategy table (Table 2) is complete and reproducible
- [ ] Database selection is appropriate for the research questions
- [ ] Date ranges are justified
- [ ] Search terms are specific enough to be replicated

**Comments:**


### 3.2 Source Selection Criteria

- [ ] Inclusion criteria are clearly stated and appropriate
- [ ] Exclusion criteria are clearly stated and appropriate
- [ ] The screening process is documented (literature flow diagram)
- [ ] Final corpus size (41 sources) is appropriate for a narrative review

**Comments:**


### 3.3 Limitation Acknowledgment

- [ ] Single-coder limitation is explicitly acknowledged
- [ ] Post-hoc selection criteria limitation is acknowledged
- [ ] Lack of protocol registration is acknowledged

### 4.1 Absence of Promotional Language

- [ ] No "strategic imperative" or similar urgency language

**Comments:**


### 4.2 Scholarly Tone

- [ ] Claims are appropriately hedged where evidence is limited
- [ ] Causal language is avoided where only correlations are established
- [ ] Speculation is clearly distinguished from evidence
- [ ] The tone is analytical rather than persuasive

**Comments:**
