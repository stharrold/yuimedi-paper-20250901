Dear Editor,

I am writing to resubmit the manuscript "Mitigating Institutional Amnesia: A Design Science Framework for Socio-Technical Query Governance in Healthcare" (ms#91493) for consideration as a **Viewpoint** article in JMIR Medical Informatics.

## Response to Decision E2

I appreciate the editor's feedback that the work is "interesting" and the invitation to resubmit after addressing the length concern. The original submission was approximately 12,730 words, which the editor correctly identified as "thesis length."

## Summary of Revisions

The manuscript has been substantially revised to meet Viewpoint article requirements:

**Structural changes:**

- Reduced from approximately 12,730 words to approximately 3,600 body words (within the 5,000-word recommendation)
- Converted from IMRD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) to descriptive thematic headers appropriate for Viewpoint articles
- Converted the structured abstract to an unstructured flowing narrative (302 words)

**Content focus:**

The revised manuscript retains the core intellectual contributions while removing the exhaustive methodology and literature review sections appropriate for a full research paper:

- **Human-in-the-Loop Semantic Governance (HiL-SG) framework:** The socio-technical architecture for converting tacit domain expertise into durable validated query triples
- **Theoretical grounding in Nonaka's SECI model:** Reinterpretation of knowledge creation theory for the unstable healthcare workforce
- **The Validator Paradox:** Intellectually honest engagement with the circular objection to the framework, resolved through Lean "Standard Work"
- **Analytics Resilience Index (ARI):** A proposed measurement instrument complementing static maturity models with dynamic resilience metrics
- **Three pillars of evidence:** Synthesized evidence on analytics maturity, workforce agility, and technical enablement

**Quality assurance:**

- All citations updated to 2024-2025 data where available
- Product neutrality verified (framework is descriptive, not prescriptive; conversational AI framed as enabler, not solution)
- Competing interests disclosed per JMIR requirements

## Article Type

This submission is a **Viewpoint** article: an evidence-based scholarly perspective on mitigating institutional amnesia in healthcare analytics, grounded in peer-reviewed literature and knowledge management theory.

Thank you for your continued consideration.
