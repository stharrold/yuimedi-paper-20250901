# Changing the submitting user for a manuscript submission

**Source:** https://support.jmir.org/hc/en-us/articles/115000451291-Changing-the-submitting-user-for-a-manuscript-submission

---

## Understanding Roles

The **submitting user** is the user who can log in to the manuscript homepage and see and respond to all communications.

The **corresponding author** appears in the manuscript as "Corresponding Author" and is indicated in the metadata form as such.

The corresponding author may or may not be identical to the submitting user. In other words, it is entirely possible to publish a manuscript where the published corresponding author is not the submitting user (the submitting user doesn't even have to be an author) and vice versa.

## How to Change the Submitting User

This article describes how to change the submitting user. To change the corresponding author, see: Change your author details before publication.

### Steps to Change Submitting User

Please follow these steps to change the submitting user to a co-author already listed on the submission:

1. Go to the article summary page (e.g., User Home / Author / Active / Article Summary tab)
2. In the "GENERAL INFORMATION" section, beside the submitter name, there is a link called 'change to another user'
3. Click on the link and make one of the co-authors the submitting user for further editing of the manuscript and communication with the editorial office

### Requirements for New Submitting User

If a co-author does not have an account with JMIR and an ORCID, please let them know to:
- Create an account at JMIR
- Authenticate the ORCID upon login
- Update the ORCID of the co-author on the metadata of the associated article

**Note:** Only a co-author that has an account with JMIR and an ORCID can be a new submitting user.

## Handing Over the Paper

To hand over the paper to a co-author for further editing and communication with the editorial office, the submitting author first needs to:
- Enter the ORCID of the co-author in the metadata form
- Make sure they have a user account (ask them to add their ORCID to their user profile)

## Getting Help

If you have trouble, please contact support@jmir.org and ask JMIR staff to change the submitting author to one of the co-authors. Make sure this user has an account and please provide their username.
