Submitting authors can track the status of their submission on their author homepage. If you can't find your paper, check the following:

## Are you logged in with the correct user account?

Some users have multiple accounts. You may not see your submission if you login with a different username.

Log out, check the "Submission Acknowledgement" confirmation email to see under which username the manuscript was originally submitted under, and then login again with the correct username.

If you have multiple user accounts, enter an ORCID into the profile information of each user to avoid these problems going forward as we will link manuscripts belonging to the same individual as identified by a verified ORCID.

## Are you the original submitting author, or a co-author?

Only the original submitting author logged in with the correct username can edit/revise a submitted manuscript. Even if you are named "corresponding author" in the paper, only the submitting user can edit/revise a manuscript.

Read "How to change the submitting author, i.e. hand over the manuscript to a co-author for further editing and communication with the editorial office?" or file a support ticket with support@jmir.org if you wish to have a manuscript transferred to another user so they can submit a revision or edit the metadata.

Unless ORCIDs are used for co-authors or the email matches, only the original submitting author can see the manuscript. If you are a co-author and just want to see the submission (not edit it), make sure you enter an ORCID into the profile information of your user account, and ask the submitting author to add your ORCID to the metadata of the submitted manuscript. This ensures that the manuscript is visible in your account.

## Did you check the Archive tab?

Rejected or already published manuscripts are no longer visible under Active, but are under the Archive tab.

If it was archived because we never received a revision within the deadline or for other reasons, it is still possible to reinstate the manuscript, subject to a nominal Manuscript Reinstatement Fee.
