JMIR Neurotechnology has introduced a new feature for relevant papers in this journal. The "NeuroTech Dialogue" box was created to provide authors with a way to briefly highlight the implications of their research.

## Purpose

To ensure that your work is accessible to a wider audience, we request that authors of clinically-focused articles include a section that clearly articulates the technical implications of their findings in plain language. Similarly, authors of technical work should provide text to articulate the clinical implications of their work.

## Requirements

- The NeuroTech Dialogue box will appear after the introduction
- Should be no longer than 250 words
- Authors should include this text after the abstract in their manuscript

We encourage authors to take advantage of this opportunity and make their research findings more accessible and applicable to a wider audience.
