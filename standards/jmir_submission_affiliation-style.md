---

Please keep in mind that JMIR is an English-language publication and that a university/institution with a different first language may typically style affiliations in a different order.

## JMIR Affiliation Style

JMIR uses a bottom-up ordering approach for its affiliations. That is, the smallest element is listed first, followed by the next largest element, then usually the university (or institution) last. These are followed by the city and country fields, respectively.

### Examples

- Bristol Interaction Group, Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom
- School of Management, Massey Business School, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand

## Exceptions

**IMPORTANT:** If your organization legally requires its subunits be to credited in a specific order, please upload documentation as a supplementary file under the "Other files" subsection. This will not be published and is only used for internal reference.

We do not make exceptions for personal preferences.
