# How do I prevent my article from being transferred to another journal when it is rejected? (cascading peer-review)

As disclosed on our website (see author guidelines), on this FAQ ("Why has my article been transferred to another journal (or a transfer has been suggested), and what are my options?") as well as during the submission process (submission checklist), all JMIR journals use a system of portable peer-review (also called cascading peer-review).

This is a system which is not unique to JMIR Publications, but used by many other publishers as well:

**Quote from Phil Davis, Scholarly Kitchen:**
"Apart from reducing the redundancy of having a paper shepherded through the peer-review process a second or third time, internal manuscript and peer-review referral services offers real value to the submitting author, i.e., faster publishing."

## Disclosure to Authors

We clearly disclose this system to our authors. On submission, there is a checklist which all authors have to go through. One of the checklist items spells out the cascading peer-review process.

Authors must check this item to indicate that they have read and understood our policy.

## How to Opt Out

**If authors want to opt out, or have only specific journals considered, they can mention this in their cover letter.**

If authors do not opt out, we may transfer a submission to another journal if:
- The paper is rejected for the journal it was originally submitted to
- We feel it is a better fit for another JMIR journal
