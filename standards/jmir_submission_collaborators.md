Contributor names of JMIR studies with collaborators which do not meet full authorship criteria but should still be indexed in PubMed can be added as follows:

## How to Add Collaborators

1. Add a group author (collaborative author) in the metadata form
2. As affiliation of this group author, write "see Acknowledgements" (or "see Authors' Contributions") in the metadata form
3. In the "Acknowledgement" (or "Authors' Contributions") section, list the group members

In PubMed, they will appear under "Collaborators".

**Example:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22209829

## Alternative Option

It is also possible to credit individual collaborators in the acknowledgment section without having a group author, but these will not appear in PubMed.
