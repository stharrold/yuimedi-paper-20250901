# We have submitted a revised manuscript. Did you get it?

Previously (until Feb 2017), we were not sending out confirmation emails when we receive a revision. Since March 2017 you now receive an email when you submit a revised manuscript.

You should be able to see the manuscript on your author homepage, and the status should have changed from "awaiting revision" to "under review".

## Important Note

Note that you must upload your revised manuscript, and on the same day send a notification email to the editor, detailing your responses to editorial and reviewer comments. Otherwise the paper may have been uploaded but the paper is not sent out for re-review (we need author responses first).
