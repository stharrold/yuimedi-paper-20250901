An Active Submission that is marked with the Status "Incomplete" can be edited on the Active Submissions list on your Author homepage.

An Active Submission that is marked with the Status "Incomplete" has not been submitted yet and needs to be finalized before the editor can even see the submission.

**Note:** As of July 2019, JMIR Publications does not charge a submission fee for any of their journals.

## Editing an Incomplete Submission

To edit click the 'title' of the submission (highlighted in blue) to go to the active submission form where you can update any of the five-steps of the form. Save the changes to each step using the 'save' button at the bottom of each page.

## Finalizing an Incomplete Submission

In step 5, there should be a submit button visible (after the submission fee has been paid).

## Deleting an Incomplete Submission

Please contact tech-support@jmir.org with the manuscript id(s) that you would like to have deleted from your author home page.
