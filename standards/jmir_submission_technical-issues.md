A small number of authors, especially those in China (related to the great Chinese firewall which blocks javascript), experience technical issues while submitting to our journals.

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Javascript

Check that your browser is not blocking Javascript. This will depend on which browser you are using. Instructions can be found here: https://www.enable-javascript.com/

We always recommend using the latest version of Chrome or Firefox to avoid technical issues.

### 2. Contact Technical Support

If you are sure that Javascript is not the issue, you may submit a ticket to tech-support@jmir.org. Include:
- Your manuscript file (attached)
- A screenshot showing the submission page where you are stuck or where you see an error message

In exceptional cases we can submit on your behalf. Please make sure that your manuscript file follows the template listed in the submission guidelines.
