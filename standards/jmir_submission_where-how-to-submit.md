## Standard Submission Process

To submit any paper, you first need to have a (free) user account with the JMIR website.

1. **If you don't have one yet:** Go to Registration
2. **If you have a user account already:** Go to Login and click on the author role to go to your author user homepage

Before you submit, make sure you checked the relevant requirements for papers on the journal information for each journal. It is important to note whether the journal charges an Article Processing Fee on acceptance (see Are there costs involved in publishing in JMIR journals?).

## ORCID Requirement

In JMIR, all coauthors must have an ORCID (What is an ORCID?). These can be supplied during peer-review or after acceptance, but ideally they are already entered in our metadata form during submission.

Before submitting a paper we would recommend to canvas your coauthors and ask them for their ORCIDs (and point them to What is an ORCID? or ORCID.org/register if they don't have one yet).

## Submitting Your Paper

Once you have a user account, you can proceed to submit your paper:

1. Go to the home page of the journal to which you would like to submit
2. Click the "Submit" button on the journal's home page
3. Click the "New Submission" button to begin the submission process
