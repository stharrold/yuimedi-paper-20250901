**Source:** https://support.jmir.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001333167-Extension-Request-Revised-Manuscript-and-Reviewer-Responses

---

The deadline for submitting a revised manuscript is provided in the editorial decision email.

## Revision Deadlines by Decision Type

After an editorial decision B (minor revisions) or C/D (revisions/ major revisions required) has been made, authors usually have:

- **Decision B (minor revisions):** 1 week
- **Decision C (revisions):** 3 weeks
- **Decision D (major revisions):** 4 weeks

## Late Submissions

If we do not receive a revision by this deadline, the manuscript may be removed from the submission queue. However, if the authors do not intend to submit a revision, we require a formal withdrawal.

## Requesting an Extension

Authors can request an extension of the revision deadline, by a maximum of 6 weeks (after the original deadline), using the revision upload form.

Please note that after the first extension, additional extensions will be reviewed by the Editor. The Editor may decline the extension if the data is time sensitive.

## How to Request an Extension

The extension request is made on the form where you would submit your revision (click on the link "awaiting revision" on the author homepage), as shown in the screenshot below.
