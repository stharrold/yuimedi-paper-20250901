# How to submit to a JMIRx journal

**Source:** https://support.jmir.org/hc/en-us/articles/8877105828635-How-to-submit-to-a-JMIRx-journal

---

JMIRx is a series of journals, which we call "superjournals". A superjournal is a type of "overlay" journal that sits on top of preprint servers and offers peer-review and copyediting/archiving/indexing of the Version-of-Records of Preprints. It does everything a "normal" journal does, except that authors no longer have to submit their manuscript to a journal. Instead, community reviewers, acquisition and review editors find the preprints they want to publish and extend conditional offers of publication to interesting articles published in Preprint servers, as well as soliciting reviews and commentaries.

In addition to the "editorial prospecting" workflow, authors can also self-nominate their existing preprints for publication (which is the equivalent to a traditional journal submission).

**Important:** Preprints already submitted to journals are not eligible for JMIRx. Preprints already peer-reviewed but not published/under consideration by a journal are eligible for JMIRx.

## Submission Options

### A. Minimalist JMIRx Submission Form (Preferred)

Upload a Preprint and use the minimalist JMIRx submission form. The form takes only 3 minutes to fill in and only asks about the link to the preprint and peer-review options.

| Preprint Server | Target Journal | Submission Form |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| MedRxiv | JMIRx-Med (https://xmed.jmir.org) | https://med.jmirx.org/landing |
| BioRxiv | JMIRx-Bio (https://xbio.jmir.org) | https://bio.jmirx.org/landing |

**Note:** Before using this submission form, you must create an account at ORCID.org/register. While only the corresponding author requires an ORCID for submission, all authors need ORCIDs for ultimate publication.

### B. Direct Submission via JMIR Preprints

Only for papers not already on MedRxiv/BioRxiv. Submit a Preprint directly to JMIRx via the JMIR submissions portal.

| JMIRx Target Journal | Submission Link |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| JMIRx-Med | https://xmed.jmir.org/author |
| JMIRx-Bio | https://xbio.jmir.org/author |

Exposing the submission as JMIR Preprint is mandatory, as JMIRx journals are Plan P compatible journals which only accept submissions from Preprint servers.

### C. MedRxiv to Journal (M2J) - JMIRx-Med Only

Upload a Preprint to MedRxiv and then use the M2J functionality at MedRxiv to submit the paper to the Journal of Medical Internet Research. You will receive an email with a link to the JMIR submission form, where you must change the target journal to JMIRx-Med.

## Peer-Review Options

Authors can select various modalities for peer-review:

1. **Traditional editor-led narrative review reports:** The editor will try to find experts to review your preprint

2. **PREreview video journal club:** A live-streamed preprint journal club run in collaboration with PREreview, a videoconference session where experts and interested readers from all over the world join to provide constructive feedback. Discussions from the Preprint journal club can be used in lieu of peer-review.

3. **Crowd Peer Review:** Annotation-based, crowdsourced reviews using peer-review communities (hashtag communities)

4. **Plan P accredited peer-review service:** If the preprint was already reviewed by an accredited peer-review service, JMIRx will accept existing peer-review reports and publish the preprint (or transfer it to a Plan P compatible journal).

**Note:** PeerRef will no longer organise peer review as of July 5, 2023.
