## Critical Tools Policy

JMIR Publications' umbrella policy regarding critical tools (including questionnaires) which are essential to reproduce research is spelled out in the policy on access to critical research tools and instruments.

## Open Data

JMIR Publications strongly encourages authors to make data open, e.g. publish them as Multimedia Appendix. JMIR also has a journal (JMIR Data) where authors can get another paper out of their data publication. However, open data is not a formal requirement at this stage.

**Important:** All authors are expected to be able to produce, on request, the original research data for reviewers, editors, or any committees investigating alleged research misconduct.

For details please see: What is your data sharing policy?

## Open Source Code

Authors are sometimes resistant to release copyright for source code. Realistically, in the field of technology in health there are often commercial interests involved (which should be declared as COI) making the complete release of all source code or even data not a realistic goal.

It is also counterproductive as it would deter researchers (and their industry partners) from doing research on commercially available products if JMIR demanded that as part of publishing the research, the source code or product would have to be made available freely.

## Addressing Concerns

If readers/research users have specific concerns about a specific paper/research or their COIs or lack of reproducibility, we encourage readers to submit a letter to the editor. JMIR will forward this to the authors and ask for a formal response, and potentially publish them.

Individual JMIR journals may have more specific policies and JMIR is working with Editor-in-Chiefs and Editorial Boards to spell out policies or settle specific disputes.
