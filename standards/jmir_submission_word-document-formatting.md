## Word Template

We recommend that authors use our standard Word template of an article compatible with all journals from JMIR Publications. This can be downloaded from: https://asset.jmir.pub/assets/public/InstructionsForAuthorsOfJMIR.docx

## Formatting Requirements

There are no explicit formatting requirements, especially for the initial review round. On acceptance, your manuscript will be stripped of all formatting (except italics for highlighting).

### Recommendations

- **Line numbers:** We know that many reviewers prefer to see line numbers, so if possible, please enable this feature for easier review
- **Heading styles:** We prefer that you use the Heading style to indicate the hierarchy of headings (H1, H2, etc), as shown in the template

### Flexibility

We are not stringent on other formatting requirements like:
- Font type
- Line spacing
- etc.

Feel free to submit your manuscript "as is" without worrying about formatting too much, at least for the initial review round. After acceptance, a professional copyeditor will help you to clean up your manuscript for publication.
