# How should I enter author affiliations?

**Source:** https://support.jmir.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001431711-How-should-I-enter-author-affiliations

---

Each author usually has at least one or multiple affiliations, which the corresponding/submitting author can edit in the Metadata Form.

## How Affiliations Are Displayed

Affiliations are entered into the metadata form and rendered in the final publication as footnotes.

## Formatting Rules

### Hierarchical Order

Please ensure that the units within each affiliation are in hierarchical order from largest to smallest.

Example: Enter the university name first, then the faculty name, then the department name

### Multiple Affiliations

- Organizations that are not administratively linked must be listed as separate affiliations
- If authors have multiple affiliations, all affiliations must be entered (as separate entries)
- This includes multiple departments within the same university/institution
- There should be only one affiliation footnote for identical affiliations (if the metadata form is completed correctly, this should occur automatically)

### Style Requirements

- **No short forms or acronyms:** Do not use short forms or acronyms
- **Do not abbreviate:** "Dep." or "Dept." should not be abbreviated
  - An affiliation like "Nursing" should be changed into "Department of Nursing"
  - Acronyms like "UHN" should be expanded to "University Health Network"
- **Title case:** Affiliations are usually in title case (all words except minor words like "of" or "on" are capitalized)
  - Do not enter information in ALL CAPS or all lower case
  - "Department of Nursing" = correct
  - "department of nursing" = incorrect
- **Expand all acronyms:** All acronyms must be expanded or removed

### What Not to Include

- Do not include the postal code (postal code only entered for the corresponding author)
- Do not include the author's position (eg, director, professor)

## Corresponding Author Information

Include the following:
- Corresponding author's name
- Degree(s)
- Group/school/department
- Institution
- Mailing address (including postal or zip code)
- Phone number
- Fax number
- Email address

### Phone and Fax Numbers

- Include the country code in telephone and fax numbers (eg, in North America, the country code is 1)
- Do not use brackets or hyphens in telephone and fax numbers

## Authors With No Affiliation (Patients With Lived Experience)

In cases where an author does not have an affiliated institution, particularly because they are a patient with lived experience or something similar, please use one of the following approved styles:

- "Patient partner"
- "Stakeholders with living experience of"
