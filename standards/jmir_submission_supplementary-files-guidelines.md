## Figures

### File Requirements

- Leave figures in the manuscript file during the initial round(s) of peer-review, but also upload high-quality figures in PNG format as supplementary files
- On the Summary tab for your article, in the top Submission section, upload a supplementary file and select Figure as the file type
- You will not be able to upload a JPG, .docx, PDF, .gif, .pptx, etc. file to be used as a figure
- After acceptance (during copyediting) all figures will be removed from the manuscript and we will only use the images/captions uploaded to the system

**Technical specifications:**
- Figures should not have any transparent sections; our system will render them incorrectly
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Maximum dimensions: 1200 x 1200 pixels
- Images larger than this could be uploaded as a Multimedia Appendix file instead

**Permissions:** If a figure featuring a person shows identifiable features of the model (ie, the model's face, tattoos, etc), then we require the authors to obtain and provide permission from the model for their image to be published. If the model is under 18, permission should be given by their legal guardian.

### Captions

- Each figure must have a caption which can be entered into the "Caption" field in the figure's metadata
- Use sentence case for the caption (as opposed to title case) with a period at the end
- Captions should be succinct; lengthy explanations should be moved to the body of the manuscript
- Each figure should be designed so that it can be easily understood by the reader without consulting the main body of the manuscript
- Do not include figure numbers and captions as part of the image files
- Figure captions should not include figure label/numbers like "Figure 1, Figure 2, etc." as these labels will be added automatically

### Use of Color

Color figures are permitted and encouraged. However, authors should be advised that the use of color alone to code different categories of data is problematic as some readers may print out a black-and-white copy.

**Recommendations:**
- Use different symbols for data points belonging to different categories (circle, diamond, square)
- Use different line types (dotted vs continuous) for different categories
- Include a legend with sample symbols/sample color
- Annotate lines/datapoints directly within the chart

### Mentioning Figures in the Text

- All figures must be mentioned in the text or else our system will not insert the figure
- Replace expressions like "as the following figure shows" with "as Figure x shows"
- Do not allude to the figure's location in the text (figures may be moved during typesetting)
- When referring to multiple figures, use a hyphen to show a range (ie, Figures 1-4) or list each figure separately
- Do not use Figure 1a, 1b, etc, for separate figures; renumber as individual figures

### AI-Generated Images

Use of artificial intelligence tools for generating figures should be disclosed in the figure caption, in addition to appropriate citation of the prompt used and a link (citation) to the source image.

### Forest Plots

For figures containing a forest plot (typically generated using statistical software), reference citations corresponding to the studies mentioned in the plot must be cited in the figure caption for enhanced accessibility.

## Multimedia Appendix

Multimedia Appendices (MAs) are published at the end of a paper.

**Note:** MAs are not copyedited by the publishing team, and it is therefore the authors' responsibility to ensure relevance, accuracy, and completeness of each MA file.

### Examples of MA Content

- Questionnaires
- Datasets
- Videos or screencasts
- PowerPoint files
- Tables too long for the body of the manuscript
- PDF files showing multiple screenshots
- Files containing the source code of a computer program
- Informed consent documents
- Reporting guideline checklists (eg, CONSORT-EHEALTH, PRISMA, PRISMA-ScR)

**Do not include** a title (first) page as the manuscript title is likely to change during the production process.

### File Requirements

**Acceptable file extensions:** .png, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pdf, .txt, .mov, .mp4, .avi, .zip, .rar, .7z

- **Images (PNG):** Maximum file size 5MB, no restriction on width and height
- **Movies (.mov, .mp4, .avi):** Maximum file size 200MB
- **Other formats:** Maximum file size 255MB

**Important notes:**
- One file per appendix
- Multiple files should not be zipped together; upload as separate supplementary files
- Exception: Multiple files containing computer code may be packed as one MA
- Word documents are automatically converted to PDF; recommend converting manually first

### Captions

- Enter captions in the "caption" field in the database for the file
- Do not include MA label/number in the caption (eg, "Multimedia Appendix 1")
- MAs should be mentioned in sequential order in the main manuscript
- Name individual items within a single MA file as "Table S1, Table S2, Figure S1, Figure S2"
- Number items as S1, S2, S3... in order of appearance

**Citing supplementary items in text:**
- "...as shown in Figure S1 in Multimedia Appendix 1"
- "...performed better than the control group (Table S2 in Multimedia Appendix 3)"

### References in Multimedia Appendices

References cited within a multimedia appendix should have a corresponding, stand-alone reference list within that same MA file, even if some references overlap with the main manuscript's reference list.

**Exception:** If an appendix contains references for studies included in the main analysis (eg, eligible studies in a review article), ensure these are also included in the main manuscript's reference list.

## Additional Material (Not Published)

We recommend uploading:
- A tracked-changes version
- Responses to reviewers
- Potentially overlapping material/publications submitted or published in other journals
- Reporting checklists (CONSORT/CONSORT-EHEALTH, PRISMA)

## Table-of-Contents (TOC) Image

A TOC image is a "cover" image published in the Table of Contents and homepage.

### File Requirements

- Only PNG is permitted (no JPG, .docx, PDF, .gif, .pptx)
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Minimum dimension: 300 x 225 pixels
- Maximum dimension: 1200 x 900 pixels

### TOC Metadata

- **Description:** Not mandatory; describe screenshots of apps, programs, or websites
- **Source:** Name of website (eg, "Pexels" or "Wikimedia Commons") or "Image created by the authors"
- **Copyright:** Name of person who took the photo (eg, "Bill Smith" or "The Authors")
- **Source Image URL:** Link to the page with the image, not just the homepage
- **License:** Select "CC-BY" for same license as article, "Licensed by JMIR" for more protection, or "Licensed by the authors" if purchased (requires proof of purchase)

## License to Publish

After your manuscript is accepted, please sign and upload the License to Publish.
