# Can I submit a paper that has previously published on a different Preprint server (such as arXiv/MedRxiv)?

**Yes.** We advocate open science and have no issues with submissions that were previously posted on other preprint servers.

We ask that you disclose this fact in the cover "letter" (comments to the editor when you submit). If you have any previous peer-reviews, please upload them as well.

## M2JMIR (MedRxiv to JMIR)

If you already submitted a preprint to MedRxiv, and it is not formally submitted to a journal yet, you can easily submit it to a JMIR journal using their submission interface.

By default, you are submitting to J Med Internet Res, but you can change the target journal (see journal portfolio) in the JMIR submission form.

For full details on how to transfer your MedRxiv/BioRxiv preprint submission to a JMIR journal, see "Submitting manuscripts from MedRxiv/BioRxiv to JMIR journals."

## Using the JMIR Preprint Server Instead

Our preferred pathway is that authors submit to a JMIR journal and opt-in to expose the submitted manuscript as preprint (possibly for open peer-review) immediately after submission. In this case:

- We will create a preprint on http://preprints.jmir.org
- Assign a DOI to your manuscript
- This makes it a citable preprint which authors can cite (e.g., in grant applications)
- The DOI will redirect to the published Version of Record if published in a JMIR journal or elsewhere
- The paper will remain on the JMIR preprint server even after rejection

## Keep the Number of Preprints to a Minimum

While nothing stops authors from posting their manuscripts on every preprint server on the planet (even after publication), authors should keep in mind:

- After publication, you want readers to find and cite the final published version (version of record)
- Make sure they cite the most recent version
- We can assure proper linking to the VoR for papers posted on our JMIR Preprints server (we even link to other journals if the paper ends up being published somewhere else)
- We have no control over third-party preprint servers and whether they will link to the "version of record" or update their citation information
- Wrong citations will have an impact on your h-index and other citation metrics

**Note:** BioRxiv/MedRxiv make efforts to link to the published VoR, but this is not the case for all preprint servers.

In addition, posting preprints on the JMIR Preprint server may help with peer-review, as it is an additional tool to recruit formal peer-reviewers.
