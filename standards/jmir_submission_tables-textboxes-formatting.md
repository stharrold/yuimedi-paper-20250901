# How should tables and textboxes be formatted?

---

Tables must be presented in the manuscript (not an extra file), using the Word table function, and should be placed in the manuscript file where they should appear in the final published paper (rather than at the end of the text).

Manuscripts undergo thorough copyediting after acceptance and our copyeditors will ensure tables are formatted correctly. However, we have outlined below general guidelines for formatting tables and specific house style for authors' reference.

Tables are meant to visually display and organize information using columns and rows. Each table should be numbered consecutively, placed close to its first mention in the text, and have a descriptive caption.

## Tables vs Textboxes

- **Use tables** to present data in a structured format with clearly defined row and column headers, typically for quantitative data or comparison.
- **Use textboxes** to present lists, such as inclusion and exclusion criteria, or to highlight specific information.

## Key Principles (from AMA Manual of Style)

For a table to have maximum effectiveness, the information it contains must be arranged logically and clearly so that the reader can quickly understand the key point and find the specific data of interest.

- Information in tables should be organized into columns and rows by type and category
- The primary comparisons should be shown horizontally across the table (English is read left to right, then top to bottom)
- Data depicting cause-and-effect or before-and-after relationships should be arranged from left to right if space allows
- Information being compared should be juxtaposed within adjacent rows or adjacent columns
- Data presented in a table should be pertinent and meaningful; tabulating all collected study data is unnecessary

**Table Length:** For most paper types, we accept tables that are maximum 1.5 pages in length in PDF (>3 pages in Word doc with font size 10-12 point). For systematic reviews, we permit tables >1.5 pages because these tables often contain data critical to the meaning of the paper.

## Presentation, Placement, and Orientation

- Tables need to be included within the manuscript's Microsoft Word file
- Tables will not be accepted as an image file
- Only upload tables as separate files if they are intended to be an appendix
- Each table is placed after, but as close as possible to, its first mention in the manuscript file
- When referring to multiple Tables, Figures, or Textboxes, use either a hyphen to show a range (eg, "Figures 1-4") or list each figure separately (eg, "Figure 1-3, Figure 6, Figure 8")
- Do not format tables on a landscape page and do not use smaller font
- Tables are typeset in portrait orientation and in the same font as the rest of the manuscript

**Large Tables:** Tables that are too long (>1.5 PDF pages) may require authors to:
1. Move it to the Multimedia Appendices, or
2. Split it into shorter tables of acceptable length (<3 pages in Word doc) if the content is critical

This is generally non-negotiable (exceptions made only for Systematic Reviews).

## Table Components

### Title/Caption

Each table requires a brief description that summarizes the topic of the table succinctly. Background information or interpretation of the data in the table do not belong in caption and should instead be placed in the body of the manuscript.

### Cells

- Do not use a soft line break within a table cell to separate different categories/subcategories
- For each new row of information, create a new table row rather than using line breaks
- Values for sample sizes and percents should be presented in the same column as "n (%)"
- Column totals should be added to the header rather than featured in a final "Total" row
- Bulleted lists can be used sparingly in tables for cells which have multiple pieces of pertinent information

### Column Headings

- Each column requires a heading that describes the information presented in that column
- An exception can be made for the first column since in some cases a heading is not applicable
- The unit of measurement is usually presented in the column heading
- Units of measurement are separated from the column description with a comma
- Column headings are written in sentence case

**Examples:**
- P value
- Participants, n (%)
- Control group (N=50), n (%)

### Row Headings

- The row headings are in the left-most column of the table
- Each row requires a heading that describes the information presented in that row
- If units of measurements are not provided in the column heading, they should be placed in the row heading
- Row headings are written in sentence case

### Category Headings

Category headings are frequently used to group sets of variables (eg, race, income strata, and gender). Category headings must be marked in bold.

To format category headings:
- Category headings and the subcategories are placed in separate columns to preserve indenting
- The first column will contain the bolded category heading (eg, "Age (years), n (%)")
- The subcategories will be placed in rows in the second column (eg, "13" and "14")
- Merge the cell containing the category heading with the cells to the right of it so the category heading spans the column(s) with the subcategories

### Footnotes

Footnotes are used to supply additional information for the entire table, a row, a column, a category, or a single data entry.

- The footnotes should appear in alphabetical order from left to right, top to bottom within the table
- All footnote symbols within a table are superscripted letters (a-z)
- The use of *, **, *** footnotes to mark significance levels (eg, P<.05, P<.01, P<.001) is discouraged; authors are asked to provide exact P values instead
- Footnotes are placed in a list directly after the table
- All footnotes presented in this list require a corresponding letter within the table

**Exceptions for *, **, *** significance notation:**
- In tables of systematic reviews, which tend to be busy and where the original P values can't be found
- When odds ratios instead of P values are presented
- If for any reason authors are unable to provide the exact P values

## Forest Plots

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews often contain forest plots to summarize their results. These display individual study results (tabularly) and, usually, the weighted mean of studies (graphically) included in a meta-analysis focused on a specific outcome.

- Forest plots generated using statistical software can be retained as figures
- Forest plots may also be presented as tables; in this case, reference citations should be placed alongside the authors' names
