# My paper has some material that is more appropriate for a Multimedia Appendix than the main manuscript. How do I make sure the sources are included in the reference list?

## Recommendation

Studies included in the main analysis (eg, a list of "included" or "eligible" studies in a systematic or scoping review article) must be cited in the manuscript's main body and its reference list.

You can add a sentence like "We included 278 publications [1-278]..." as close as possible to the in-text mention of the Multimedia Appendix, Table, Figure, etc.

## Table Length Limits

Note: JMIR typically does not allow tables that are more than 1.5 pages in length to appear in the main manuscript (>3 pages in Word doc with font size 10-12 point), so the content of such a table will need to be moved to a Multimedia Appendix.
