Authors should ensure they are submitting their paper to the JMIR journal that best fits with the journal's focus and scope. The focus and scope of each journal is outlined on the journal's website.

## Choosing a Section

Once the journal has been chosen, submitting authors will also be required to choose which section of the journal is most appropriate for their paper.

While most journals do have some sections in common, such as:
- Editorials
- Viewpoints
- Original Papers

Each journal will feature sections that are particular to that area of research and/or discipline.

## How to Select

Please use the dropdown menu to choose the Journal Section within the journal that best suits your paper.

If submitting to a specific Theme Issue within a journal, use the dropdown to find the Theme Issue to which you wish to submit.
