## Steps to Add a Group Author

1. Login into your JMIR account and click on the paper title
2. Under the Summary tab, scroll down to Submission Metadata, and click "Edit Metadata"
3. Click "Add an Author"
4. Just above the Author Information box, tick off "Collaborative (Group) Author" (instead of Individual Author as you would normally do for a single author)
5. Fill out the information underneath

## Acknowledging Group Members

Members of a collaborative (group) author should also be listed and acknowledged in the Authors' Contribution section in the manuscript.

Include the first and last names of the members, with one person per line (ie, do not have all the members in a paragraph separated with commas). These will be added to the PubMed abstract information post-copyediting stage.

Authors should acknowledge members of the collaborative group in the Authors' Contributions section of their manuscript, listing the members of the collaborative group.
