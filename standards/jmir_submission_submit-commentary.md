# How do I submit a commentary?

## Commentary Format

A commentary is published alongside other articles published in JMIR Publications journals. The commentary can only be considered for the journal in which the original article is published. For example, if the original article was published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, then the commentary can only be considered for the Journal of Medical Internet Research and would not be transferred to another JMIR Publications journal as a commentary.

Commentaries are typically invited. Unsolicited commentaries may be considered at the discretion of the editor.

Importantly, articles submitted as an invited commentary should offer thoughtful comments in relation to the published work and topic(s) of focus, drawing from evidence, expertise, and/or additional perspectives.

The main headings within the paper can be IMRD or free. Original data are not typically published within commentaries.

An unstructured abstract should be provided that briefly summarizes the key points of the Commentary.

There is no APF for invited Commentaries.

## Requirements

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Author limit | Maximum of 3 |
| Abstract | 1-2 sentence summary of the article and key message(s) |
| Length | 1000 words |
| References | 10; the first reference should cite the JMIR Publications paper on which the article is commenting |
| Figures/Tables | 1 |

## Alternative Article Types

- **Viewpoint article type:** More appropriate for written perspectives not explicitly related to an already published article in a JMIR Publications journal
- **Letter to the Editor:** More appropriate option for an unsolicited, short (500 words or less) yet substantial comment, feedback, or critique related to a paper previously published in a JMIR Publications journal

## How to Submit an Invited Commentary

Invited authors can submit a commentary as a new submission in the regular submission system for the relevant JMIR Publications journal.

1. Choose the section "Commentary" from the drop-down list in the submission process
2. When you submit your Commentary, include the following required information in the cover letter:
   - Confirmation that it is an invited commentary submission
   - The name of the editor who invited your submission
   - The manuscript ID, title, and URL of the article you are commenting on

## Editorial Process

Invited commentaries undergo editorial review. Peer review may be conducted at the discretion of the editor.

The editor may recommend reformatting the Commentary to a Viewpoint when the manuscript does not meet the requirements of a Commentary.

If the Commentary is accepted for publication, there is no article processing fee (APF) for the author(s).

If the submitted manuscript does not meet the format of Commentary, or if the editor deems the manuscript to be a Viewpoint or other article type, the standard applicable APF for the journal article type applies.
