See: Adding Authors to New and Incomplete Submissions for how to get to the metadata form that lists all the authors.

## Important Notes

- **If changing authorship:** Please see "How to change (add/drop) authors after/during peer-review but before publication." Steps for making authorship changes are different.
- **If only changing the corresponding author:** See "How to change the corresponding author"

## How to Change Author Order

Changing the author order is done simply by clicking the "move author up" and "move author down" buttons, and then saving the author metadata.

Authors should show up in the order they are entered. If this is not the case, please file a bug report.
