# I am submitting a paper and I am asked to suggest peer-reviewers, but don't know who to suggest. Can I bypass this step?

No. The policy at JMIR journals is that authors must suggest peer-reviewers, which we may or may not use.

## How to Find Potential Reviewers

**Tip:** To find potential reviewers, search PubMed for similar papers. Some of them list email addresses of the first authors (click the plus sign next to Author Information). Suggest these names and email addresses.

## Conflict of Interest

Do not suggest reviewers which have a potential conflict of interest.

See: How does JMIR define a Conflict of Interest (COI)?

## WARNING: Peer-Review Fraud

Instances of attempted or actual peer-review fraud, where authors knowingly nominate peer-reviewers which have an obvious competing interest, who contact or influence reviewers to submit reviews, or who assume false identities as "fake reviewers" will be treated as scientific misconduct.

We will reserve steps such as:
- Immediate rejection or retraction of already published manuscripts
- Informing the host institution of authors about the attempted or actual misconduct
