---

If you published a protocol in JMIR Research Protocols (RR1, Registered Report Stage 1), then your manuscript that reports the final results of the study is considered a RR2 (Registered Report Stage 2).

## How to Apply for the Discount

To apply for a 20% discount on the Article Processing Fee (and also to make sure that the RR2 links back to the published study protocol (RR1)), please enter the DOI or IRRID of the protocol manuscript in the relevant metadata form when submitting the results manuscript (RR2).

## Eligibility Requirements

Results manuscripts (RR2) are NOT eligible for a 20% discount if at least one of the following applies:

- The provided DOI/IRRID is not a study protocol for the currently submitted manuscript (for example, a provided DOI for a related published study is not a RR1; or, if the study protocol is for a different study, even if it is a RR1, it is not applicable to the currently submitted manuscript)
- The study protocol was not published in JMIR Research Protocols

## Verification

JMIR Publications staff and editors will verify that the study protocol (RR1) is related to the submitted results manuscript (RR2) before the 20% discount is applied.
