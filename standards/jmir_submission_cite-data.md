# How should I cite data?

**Source:** https://support.jmir.org/hc/en-us/articles/360017805771-How-should-I-cite-data

---

Data requires citations for the same reasons journal articles and other publications require citations: to acknowledge the original author/producer and help other researchers find the resource.

## Dataset Citation Components

A dataset citation includes all of the same components as any other citation:

- Author
- Title
- Year of publication
- Publisher (for data, this is often the archive where it is housed)
- Edition or version
- Access information (a URL, DOI, or another persistent identifier)

## Archiving and Citing Data

JMIR suggests using DataCite or another appropriate publicly available database or repository to facilitate archiving and citing of datasets.

Alternatively, data can be submitted/published separately in JMIR Data (https://data.jmir.org/) and cited accordingly.

Data should be cited where referenced in the manuscript text.

## Data Availability Statement

Authors are strongly recommended to add a section on 'Data Availability' in their manuscript.

- Data sharing statements should appear after the Acknowledgements
- The statement should provide a reason and possible steps for requesting access if access is restricted
- If there is code generated during the study, links to code availability are also recommended
