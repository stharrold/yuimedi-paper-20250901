Listed affiliations should reflect the author's institutional affiliation at the time the work was done. If the author has since moved, the current affiliation also should be provided.

## How to Handle

Please enter your affiliations into our metadata as normal and add a sentence to your Acknowledgments section describing your involvement with each.

### Example

"YvK was affiliated with the Flinders Digital Health Research Centre at Flinders University at the time of the trial and is currently affiliated with Adaptive Social and Economic Systems at CSIRO."
