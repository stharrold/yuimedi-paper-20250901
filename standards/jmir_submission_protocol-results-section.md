Major headings for ALL original papers must be Introduction - Methods - Results - Discussion.

## Results Section Required for Protocols

A "Results" section also must be present in protocols, in the abstract as well as the main body of the manuscript, where you briefly mention the timeline of the research.

## What to Include

Add a "Results" section to the abstract and main body of the manuscript (even if it is only 1-2 sentences) with information on the current status such as:

- "funded in" (month/year)
- Date(s) of data collection (actual or projected start/end)
- Numbers recruited as of submission of the manuscript
- Status of data analysis and expected results to be published in (season/year), if this information is available

### Important Notes

- Please avoid phrases like "To date, we enrolled xxx participants"
- Rather, state specific dates such as "As of September 2018, we enrolled...."
- Please do not forget to update the abstract in the metadata form!

## IRB/Ethics Approval

Information on approval by IRB (date)/ethics approval should be presented in the Methods section.
