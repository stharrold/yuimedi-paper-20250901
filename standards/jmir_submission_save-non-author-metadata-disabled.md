If during the submission process, after inserting information for all authors and title and abstract in the metadata form, you are not able to proceed to the next step, because the button 'Save non-author Metadata' is disabled, then please remember to click on every "Save Author" button to save changes related to authors.

Those changes must be individually saved before proceeding, otherwise the "Save non-author Metadata" button will appear disabled.
