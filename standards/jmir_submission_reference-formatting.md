# How should references be formatted?

**Source:** https://support.jmir.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001333067-How-should-references-be-formatted-Which-journal-style-should-I-choose-when-using-EndNote-or-other-reference-management-software

---

JMIR Publications has developed proprietary software (OrangeX) and a unique production process where, during copyediting, all references are extracted from the manuscript file, parsed, matched against various online databases (eg, PubMed and CrossRef), and automatically corrected.

In order for our system to recognize in-text citations and for our reference software, RefCheck, to complete its automated processes, specific formatting must be applied.

## In the Manuscript

### In-text Citations

- Cite in-text references in square brackets in numerical order of their appearance in the manuscript (eg, [1], [1,3,18]).
- Separate consecutive citations using a hyphen (eg, [2-13]).

### Reference List

- List references in numerical order at the end of the manuscript using MS Word's numbered list function (1., 2., 3., ...).
- The numbering used must match the in-text citations.
- Only one publication can be listed for each reference number.
- Do not add unpublished materials (oral, written, or email-based personal communications or papers not yet accepted for publication).
- If references are added or removed during peer review, they will be automatically renumbered during typesetting. Authors should not manually renumber or fix citations after acceptance.

## Reference Management System (EndNote and Mendeley)

If you wish to use a bibliographic reference management system, please choose one that allows you to output the PMID (PubMed ID) after each journal reference.

You can download the EndNote output styles for all JMIR journals from the EndNote website.

### Removal of Field Codes/Hyperlinks

If you use a reference management system (eg, EndNote), in-text references (and the bibliography) may appear as field codes (can be recognized by a gray background). In this case, make sure to remove all field codes and hidden links from the manuscript.

Before resubmitting your revised manuscript after acceptance:

1. Open your document in Microsoft Word
2. Select Tools
3. Click EndNote (or Reference Manager)
4. Click Remove Field Codes or Convert to Plain Text

To remove hidden hyperlinks:

1. Select all text (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+F9 (or Cmd+6)

Using these methods, your in-text citations and bibliography will render as plain text without field codes or any hidden links. Save this version under a new file name and upload this as your final manuscript version.

## Reference Formatting

### General Information

A reference can be formatted as a journal reference, book or book chapter, conference proceeding, or web reference. We recommend formatting references according to the AMA Manual of Style (11th edition).

Minor variation in reference format is acceptable as long as the correct digital identifier is provided for each reference (if available).

For electronic journals that use electronic article IDs in lieu of page numbers, use the article ID as used in the journal (eg, "e123").

### Database Digital Identifiers

JMIR's reference software, RefCheck, looks up references in online databases to correct them. Minor errors in references (eg, errors in author names, titles) can be automatically corrected using database identifiers like DOIs and PMIDs (eg, for journals, conference proceedings), if available.

**PMID and DOI:**
Add the PMID or DOI at the end of each journal reference without brackets manually or using a reference management system that allows this. Format as follows:
- PMID:1234567 or PMID: 1234567
- doi:10.1159/000398269 or doi: 10.1159/000398269

**ISBN:**
For books and book chapters, add the ISBN number at the end of the reference (eg, ISBN:12342345X).

### Preprints

Cite preprints as you would journal references. Include the full date (eg, Sept 23, 2020) that the preprint was posted online. Your copyeditor will ensure the preprint reference is formatted correctly in the final typeset PDF.

### Web References

- Add all web pages and URLs cited in the manuscript as a reference.
- Government reports, Pew Internet research reports, and other "gray" publications (eg, dissertations) are often freely available on the internet; add a URL linking directly to the PDF.
- Provide an access date.
- Avoid using URLs from a search result. Provide the direct link.
- Software is cited as a web reference only if it is the subject of the paper.
- Do not provide Webcite IDs for web references, as these are now defunct.

### In Press/Forthcoming References

**Submitted or under peer review:**
- Do not include submitted papers or papers in preparation in your reference list.
- Instead, cite these as unpublished data in the text parenthetically (eg, HE Marman, MD, unpublished data, January 2015).
- Note that citing unpublished data does not conform to best practices. You may want to cite these as personal communications instead.

**Accepted:**
- Cite as "forthcoming" in the reference list by adding the term "forthcoming" after the journal name in parentheses
- Update references previously cited as "forthcoming" if they are published before your paper enters copyediting (add the PMID or DOI if known).
