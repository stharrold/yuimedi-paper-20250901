# My paper is submitted / under review and I have to make a correction or forgot an important part in the manuscript or have to change the manuscript file - can I upload an updated version?

Because the manuscript may already be under review, changing an already submitted manuscript is normally not possible. You can, however, edit the metadata (for example, add authors).

You can also add material as supplementary files but there is no guarantee that the reviewers (who may already have downloaded the material) see the additional information, unless you do this right away after submission.

## Small Corrections

If your correction is small we would strongly suggest to wait until the round 1 peer-review is completed and the initial editorial decision email has been received. You can then make the corrections together with submitting the revision.

## Major Errors

If you noticed a major error (for example, an entire section in the manuscript is missing, or you submitted a wrong manuscript version), we recommend to:

1. Add a supplementary file to your submission (describing it as corrected, final manuscript file for round 1 review)
2. File a ticket with editorial staff asking to replace the current review version with the supplementary file

Still, we cannot guarantee that the paper hasn't already been reviewed, so the reviewer comments may or may not refer to the old version of the manuscript. Therefore, this should only be used in exceptional cases.

## Other Scenarios

- **If your paper is already accepted but not yet published:** See "Making Changes to Accepted Manuscripts (Corrections, Additions, and Acknowledgments)"
- **If your paper is already published:** See "How to submit a corrigendum (correction) or addendum"
