According to COPE, plagiarism is defined as a situation "When somebody presents the work of others (data, words or theories) as if they were his/her own and without proper acknowledgment" [1].

A content overlap of just 10% may be considered duplicative.

**AI plagiarism** is when authors pass off or take credit for the production of statements that were generated by artificial intelligence (AI).

Any forms of plagiarism are deemed not acceptable or ethical, and would be examined carefully in accordance with COPE guidance [2,3].
