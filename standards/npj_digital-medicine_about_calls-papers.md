# Moving from Problem Statements to Solutions: Implementing and Scaling Digital Medicine in Low-Resourced Settings

**Collection Type:** Collection
**Submission Status:** Open
**Submission Deadline:** 16 July 2026

This Collection supports and amplifies research related to SDG3 and SDG10.

## Overview

Despite the rapid growth of digital medicine technologies, many implementers of promising digital medicine products and services struggle to bridge a persistent implementation gap between proof of concept and real-world benefits in low-resourced settings. These technologies include AI-driven medical devices, telemedicine and virtual care models, wellness apps, and wearables.

For this collection, the editors use the term 'low-resourced settings' to describe contexts in any country where digital medicine technologies may be utilized, and there are limited health system resources (i.e., financial, human capital, physical, and digital infrastructure).

## Collection Focus

This collection assembles solution-oriented research, implementation science, and policy analyses that demonstrate how digital medicine within low-resourced settings could be made:

- **Clinically actionable, safe, and effective** in a real-world setting
- **Context-appropriate and cost-effective** (i.e., approaches for moving digital medicine technologies appropriately from high-resource to low-resource settings and vice versa)
- **Scalable within health system needs and realities** (i.e., cognisant of digital public infrastructure, human resources, and capabilities)

## Call for Submissions

This collection invites submissions from authors who can share real, in-the-field insights to move the current discourse beyond problem statements to practical pathways and tangible learnings for sustainable deployment, local ownership, and impactful scaling of digital medicine technologies.

## Note on Terminology

The editors of this collection acknowledge that the terminology used to classify countries and their people implies a distinct way of viewing the world and is shaped by the political and social environment. As stated above, in this collection, the editors use the term 'low-resourced settings' to describe contexts in any country where digital medicine technologies may be utilized and are characterized by limited health system resources (i.e., financial, human capital, physical, and digital infrastructure).

In the USA, for example, a low-resource setting could apply to hospitals with limited budgets that serve populations reliant on Medicaid. In sub-Saharan Africa, low-resource settings can be characterized as health systems that lack access to physical or digital infrastructure for delivering health services, and are often under-resourced in terms of clinicians or specialized medical services.

# AI-Enabled Therapies in Mental Health

**Collection Type:** Collection
**Submission Status:** Open
**Submission Deadline:** 01 May 2026

This Collection supports and amplifies research related to SDG3.

## Overview

The collection focuses on AI tools that support or deliver therapeutic interventions in mental health. This includes generative AI-based systems (e.g., LLM-powered chatbots) and other adaptive, context-aware models such as reinforcement learning–based agents that go beyond rule-based logic. We are especially interested in tools capable of autonomous therapeutic interaction, adaptation, and decision-making, as well as hybrid human-in-the-loop models that extend therapist reach—such as between-session coaching or therapeutic augmentation.

Central to this collection is an emphasis on evaluating treatment mechanisms, clinical validity and safety, and we also invite contributions that examine the ethical and regulatory implications of these rapidly evolving technologies.

Primary focus is on mental health conditions—including mood and anxiety disorders, ADHD, SUD, eating disorders, BPD, and psychosis—but we also welcome studies on AI interventions for mood or cognitive symptoms related to chronic illness (e.g., cancer distress, chronic pain).

## Topics of Interest

We invite novel innovative and clinically relevant contributions in the forms of Original Research, Reviews, Perspectives, and Case Studies covering:

- **Comparative Efficacy:** Do gen-AI therapy bots perform comparably to or outperform other non-AI driven digital therapies or standard of care? For whom and in what context? What are appropriate endpoints and control conditions to assess therapeutic outcomes?
- **Human-in-the-Loop Models:** How can AI safely extend therapist reach (e.g., between-session coaching, therapeutic scribes)? How can the quality and benefit of such tools be assessed? When do such tools transition from being assistive to qualifying as medical devices?
- **Mechanistic Insights:** How do generative or reinforcement-learning models tailor therapeutic content? What are the therapeutic ingredients that drive outcomes? What interaction styles may best drive or harm therapeutic progress (e.g. confronting patients, challenging beliefs, sycophancy/over-agreeing, etc.)? How do these mechanisms align with or diverge from evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)?
- **Safety, Risk, and Ethics:** How can AI enhance our ability to monitor and assess patients at risk (e.g. suicidality)? How can they achieve suitable patient engagement levels while preventing dependency? How can we ensure transparency of AI authorship or tackle harmful hallucinations?
- **Equity & Inclusion:** How can AI be leveraged to provide culturally adapted care, mitigate bias, and ensure efficacy across diverse populations and diagnoses?
- **Regulatory & Policy:** What are the ambiguities in the regulatory classification of mental health treatment software? How do these ambiguities vary internationally? How are such tools being marketed, and what ethical concerns arise around device claims and marketing practices?

# Digital Health Equity and Access

**Collection Type:** Collection
**Submission Status:** Open
**Submission Deadline:** 03 March 2026

## Overview

Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet disparities persist globally. Digital health technologies have the potential to bridge gaps in care, yet they can also inadvertently widen them if not designed and deployed with equity in mind.

The COVID-19 pandemic underscored both the promise and pitfalls of digital health. Telemedicine, wearables, and AI-driven diagnostics emerged as lifelines for some populations, while others—particularly those in rural, underserved, or economically disadvantaged communities—faced barriers to accessing these tools.

This Collection explores innovations and challenges in advancing digital health equity and access, focusing on diverse populations and inclusive technologies.

## Key Areas of Interest

- **Health Equity in Technology Design:** Research exploring how user-centered design can address diverse needs, particularly for underserved populations
- **Bridging the Digital Divide:** Investigations into barriers to adoption, such as technology access, affordability, and digital literacy
- **Cultural and Linguistic Adaptations:** Approaches to tailoring digital health solutions to align with cultural norms, languages, and local contexts
- **Data-Driven Equity:** Contributions leveraging AI and big data to identify, measure, and address health inequities
- **Outcomes and Impact Evaluation:** Evidence of the real-world impact of digital health technologies on reducing disparities in care and outcomes

We particularly encourage interdisciplinary submissions that combine insights from medicine, technology, public health, and social sciences.

By gathering research at the forefront of this field, this Collection aims to advance a shared understanding of how digital health can serve as a force for equity.

Together, let's create a dialogue that transforms insights into action, ensuring that digital health innovations benefit everyone.
