---

Our system follows the standard Western naming convention on the title page (FirstName LastName) and in citation formats (LastName FirstInitials), as used in PubMed and other bibliographic databases.

## How to Enter Your Name

Please ensure your name is entered in this format in the metadata:

- **First name** = given name (eg, Rui Xiang, Alexandra)
- **Last name** = family name (eg, Cheng, Smith)

## Important Note

We understand that name order conventions may vary across countries and cultures. However, please avoid switching the fields, even if you prefer a different display order.

Entering names incorrectly (eg, placing your given name in the "last name" field) can lead to:
- Indexing errors
- Making your work difficult to retrieve
- Affecting how your authorship is represented in databases
