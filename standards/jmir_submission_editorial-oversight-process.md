JMIR Publications is a reputable publisher that specializes in peer-reviewed journals focusing on digital health and technology.

The editorial oversight process at JMIR Publications typically involves the following steps:

## 1. Submission

Authors submit their manuscripts through the journal's online submission system, adhering to the guidelines and requirements outlined by the journal. All authors are notified to acknowledge receipt of a submission.

See: Where/how do I submit my paper to a JMIR journal?

## 2. Initial Screening

The editorial staff screens the submissions to ensure they meet the basic criteria of the journal, such as scope, originality, impact and adherence to the formatting guidelines. Manuscripts that do not meet these requirements may be returned to the authors without being sent for peer review.

If the manuscript does not meet originality/impact requirements for the target journal, editorial staff may, in consultation with the Editor-in-Chief (EiC), suggest a transfer to other JMIR journals. While we are waiting for the authors' response or querying EiCs, the paper may be transferred to what we call a Transfer Hub.

See: Why has my article been transferred to another journal (or a transfer has been suggested), and what are my options?

## 3. Peer Review

Manuscripts that pass the initial screening undergo a rigorous peer review process. JMIR Publications employs a single-blind peer review system, where the identities of the reviewers are concealed (reviewers are later credited on each published manuscript in case of acceptance).

We will not remove author names or affiliations from submitted manuscripts but if authors prefer a double-blind process, they can omit this information from the initially submitted manuscript.

The journal assigns knowledgeable experts in the field as peer reviewers who evaluate the manuscript's scientific merit, methodology, clarity, and significance.

If authors opt for open participation peer review on submission, we also tweet about the paper inviting reviewers to nominate themselves. Prospective reviewers confirmed as eligible to review by the journal are then assigned.

## 4. Editorial Decision

Based on the reviewers' feedback, the Editor-in-Chief or Associate Editor makes an initial editorial decision. Possible decisions include:
- Acceptance
- Revision
- Rejection
- Further review by additional experts

The decision is communicated to the authors along with the reviewers' comments and recommendations.

If there is a reviewer consensus, we may also send the peer-reviews to the author automatically as soon as at least two are available.

**Note:** We almost never accept manuscripts without any change requests, so do expect the manuscript to go through at least one "R&R" (Revision and Resubmission) round.

Editorial decisions are independent from financial ones (e.g., advertising, APFs and discount/waiver considerations).

## 5. Revision and Resubmission (R&R)

If the manuscript requires revisions, the authors are given a specific timeframe to address the reviewers' comments and make necessary changes.

Revised manuscripts are typically reevaluated by the original reviewers or (if original reviewers are not available) the editor to ensure the concerns have been adequately addressed.

It is generally JMIR policy to avoid assigning new reviewers in subsequent review rounds.

- What happens after I submitted a revised version and my responses to reviewer comments?

## 6. Acceptance and Copyediting

Once a manuscript is accepted and the Article Processing Charge is paid (e.g., by an author's institution), it undergoes a copyediting process to ensure adherence to the journal's style and formatting guidelines.

All authors must also sign a JMIR Publications License to Publish (Publishing Agreement) Form.

Authors may be asked to review and approve the edited version of their manuscript.

See: What are the steps during copyediting?

## 7. Proofreading and Publication

Authors receive proofs of their final article for review and corrections before publication.

See: What should the author do when proofreading the final galleys?

## 8. Proof Review

An in-house editor conducts a final proof review.

After finalizing the proofs, the manuscript is published online in the relevant journal of JMIR Publications and promoted using our knowledge translation tools.

## Post-Publication

If errors are detected post-publication or amendments are required, changes to articles can be made with a corrigendum.

See: How to submit a corrigendum (correction) or addendum

If post-publication discussion, debate, or review are indicated, these will be addressed in accordance with the relevant COPE guidance applicable to the nature of the situation.

See: Ethical issues and post-publication review
