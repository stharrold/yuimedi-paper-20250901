# Understanding preprint settings

---

It is not possible to change/edit or unpublish a preprint once published, but preprints can be annotated by authors and readers using the Hypothes.is annotation tool.

Authors should make corrections in subsequent revisions of the manuscript and can opt in to also display the accepted manuscript version. JMIR also always links to the final published version (Version of Record), even if not published in a JMIR journal.

## Preprint Settings Selection

Preprint settings are selected by the submitting author during the submission process and can be any of the following:
- Availability of the submitted document for everybody
- For logged-in users
- For nobody
- For open peer-review only

After submission, a preprints page is generated and these settings are also displayed on the preprints page.

## How to Change Preprint Settings

Go to the Author menu > Select your manuscript from the list. After you land on the Summary tab of your manuscript, scroll down to the bottom where there will be a section called Preprint Settings.

## Preprint Options

### Option 1: Would you like to publish your submitted manuscript as preprint?

a. Please make my preprint PDF available to anyone at any time (recommended)
b. No, I do not wish to publish my submitted manuscript as a preprint

**Note:** Immediately after submission, a DOI is assigned if the setting is set to "a." Once a DOI is issued, the preprint becomes citable, and the setting can no longer be changed to "b."

### Option 2: If accepted for publication in a JMIR journal, would you like the PDF to be visible to the public?

a. Yes, please make my accepted manuscript PDF available to anyone at any time (Recommended)
b. No. Please do not make my accepted manuscript PDF available to anyone. I understand that if I later pay to participate in JMIR's PubMed Now! service, my accepted manuscript PDF will automatically be made openly available.

### Option 3: When the final manuscript (version of record) is published

This controls the visibility of the preprint after publication in a JMIR Journal. There are no restrictions here.

### Option 4: If the submission is marked as rejected, withdrawn, or lapsed

This controls the visibility of the preprint when the article is rejected, withdrawn or lapsed. There are no restrictions here.

## Changing to More Open Settings

If you are an author and want the current settings to be changed to a more "open" setting, you can do so by going to the article summary tab and scroll down to the "Preprint Setting" section where you can update it accordingly.

## Note About Removal Concerns

In many cases authors want the Preprint removed because they fear that other journals would not accept a previously posted manuscript. However, these days virtually all publishers and journals accept manuscripts that have previously been posted on a preprint server. See the Preprint Removal Policy for details.
