## Eligibility

Only authors who have had their abstract accepted are eligible to submit a full paper after the abstract has been accepted.

**Note:** The abstract submission process is handled through iProceedings (http://chc.iproc.org). Do not submit abstracts in any of the journals below.

## How to Submit Full Paper

After acceptance of the abstract, submit your CHC full paper to JMIR Medical Informatics.

In step 1 of the submission process, select the theme issue titled "Connected Health Conference 2019" from the drop-down box under Journal Section.

**Important:** It is very important that the theme issue is chosen from the drop-down menu; otherwise, the paper may be processed in the normal submission track (ie, without the 20% discount associated with this specific theme issue).
