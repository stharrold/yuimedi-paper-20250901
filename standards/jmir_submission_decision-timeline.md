# When do you expect to make a decision for my submission?

As a matter of principle, we do not speculate or make predictions on when the editorial or peer-review process will be completed. Unfortunately, we are not able to address this question for each manuscript as this takes away valuable staff time that is better spent on more constructive issues.

## Historic Statistics

While we can provide authors with historic statistics on average turnaround times, each manuscript is different.

## When to Contact JMIR

If the question is meant rhetorically (and what you really meant is "Make a decision, already!"), then we ask you for your patience. Please contact us after 4-5 months have passed without an initial decision.

## Fast-Tracked Papers Exception

The only exception are fast-tracked papers, where we guarantee a turnaround (initial decision) time of 4 weeks (20 business days, allowing for any possible holidays in that period). Authors can fast-track a paper at any time.

See: How to fast-track (expedite) a paper and what are the benefits?

## Preprints for Grant Proposals

We recognize that many authors require a rapid decision because they need to cite initial results or formative research (e.g. submitted to JMIR Formative Res) to cite them in grant proposals.

In these cases we highly recommend to make the submission available as Preprint, which can be cited immediately after submission. Many funding agencies now allow and encourage citation of a preprint.
