## What to Include in the Degrees List

The highest degrees or professional certifications should be listed for each author. Academic degrees below the master's level are usually excluded unless they are the highest degree held by the author.

You may also include:
- Specialized degrees
- Licenses
- Certifications
- Credentials below the master's level

Bachelor's degrees can also be included if they are in a field unrelated to the higher degrees. For example, if an author reports BPharm and MPH as their degrees, both may be included.

**Note:** All authors must include a degree. The only exception is if the author does not currently have any degrees (eg, undergraduate students).

## What Not to Include

- Fellowship designations and honorary degrees
- PhD candidate is not acceptable as a degree
  - Incorrect: PhD (c), PhD (C), PhD (cand.), or PhD (ABD)
- Degree specializations or concentrations in parentheses
  - Incorrect: MSc (Geography), MD (Pediatrics)
  - Exceptions to this rule:
    - Grad diplomas like Grad Dip (Geoinformatics)
    - Board certifications
- Job titles such as "Professor" as a degree

**Note:** The European degrees "Prof Dr" and "Dr med" are fine to use, if applicable.

Any unusual degrees will be verified with the authors during the production process.

## Formatting Degrees

- Do not put periods or spaces in degree abbreviations
  - Correct: MSc, MPH, MD, PhD
  - Incorrect: Ph.D., M.P.H., M Sc
- Author degrees should be sorted from lowest to highest in the metadata form ("MPH, PhD," not "PhD, MPH")
- Use the up and down arrow buttons in the metadata form to change the order, with the lowest degree on the top
