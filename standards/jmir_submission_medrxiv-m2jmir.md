Thank you for your interest in submitting your research to JMIRx, a series of overlay journals supporting the peer review and high-quality publication of preprints.

**Important:** Submissions will not be accepted if the paper has already been submitted elsewhere, is under review, or published in another peer-reviewed journal, as this violates journal policy.

## Transfer Steps

To transfer your preprint for submission to a JMIRx journal from medRxiv, follow these 6 simple steps:

### Step 1
Click the link: "Submit medRxiv Preprint to a Journal or Peer Review Service"

### Step 2
On the following page select "Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR)" from the dropdown box and click "Submit"

### Step 3
Confirm the submission by clicking on "Complete this action"

A confirmation page will load if the above steps are completed successfully.

### Step 4
Check your email for a link to continue the submission in the JMIR submission system.

**IMPORTANT:** The submission is not complete until the author logs in and completes the submission. If you did not get that email, please contact tech-support@jmir.org.

### Step 5
Change the target journal to JMIRx Med in the drop-down list on the first page of the submission process.

### Step 6
Complete and confirm the submission to JMIRx Med.

## Note on Prepopulated Data

The submission form will be prepopulated with the metadata received from the preprint server. JMIR first either creates a new user account for the author, or matches it against existing user accounts based on ORCID or email address. Please review the prepopulated information and confirm or edit as needed.
