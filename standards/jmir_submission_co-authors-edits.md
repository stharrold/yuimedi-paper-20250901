---

Only the original submitting author logged in with the correct username can see manuscript details, respond to reviewers, or upload documents.

Even if you are named "corresponding author" in the paper, only the submitting user can edit/revise a manuscript.

## How to Transfer Responsibility

If you wish to have a manuscript transferred to another user (co-author) so they can submit a revision or edit the metadata, please see:

- Changing the submitting user for a manuscript submission
- How to change the submitting author (i.e., hand over the manuscript to a co-author for further editing and communication with the editorial office)

Or file a support ticket with support@jmir.org.
