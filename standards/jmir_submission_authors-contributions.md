# What is the "Authors' Contributions" section? How should I write mine?

**Source:** https://support.jmir.org/hc/en-us/articles/115000525871-What-is-the-Authors-Contributions-section-How-should-I-write-mine

---

The Authors' Contributions section specifies the exact contributions of each author in a narrative form. This is not a required section, but is included in the final publication if provided.

## Formatting Preferences

- The section should be titled "Authors' Contributions"
- In the Word doc, it appears after the Acknowledgments section and before Conflicts of Interest
- Only author initials are used (without titles or degrees)

### Initials Styling

- Style the initials exactly as the name appears in the metadata
  - eg, Bryan George Miller → BGM (not BM)
- If more than one author has the same initials, style as first initials-space-last name:
  - eg, Brian George Miller → BG Miller
- If more than one author has the same initials and last name, use full name:
  - eg, John Smith and Jane Smith
- If a name includes "Jr" or "Sr," style as initials-space-suffix:
  - eg, Brian George Miller Jr → BGM Jr
- If a group author is listed (eg, The CONSORT Group), all collaborators need to be listed
- Non-author collaborators or contributors must be mentioned by their full name

### Equal Contribution

Sentences such as "All authors contributed equally to this manuscript" do NOT belong in this section (nor in Acknowledgments). To declare equal contribution, use the "Equal Contribution" field in the metadata form, which will automatically render a footnote.

## Option 1: Narrative Description (old format, now discouraged)

**Example:**
> Authors' Contributions
> BGM wrote the manuscript and provided data for Table 1, SGH conducted the patient interviews, and KL conducted all statistical analyses. All authors reviewed the final manuscript.

## Option 2: CRediT Taxonomy (preferred)

The CRediT taxonomy has been an international standard since 2022. Authors are encouraged to list contributions under the following headings:

### CRediT Roles

1. **Conceptualization** – Ideas, formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.
2. **Data curation** – Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data for initial use and later re-use.
3. **Formal analysis** – Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze or synthesize study data.
4. **Funding acquisition** – Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.
5. **Investigation** – Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection.
6. **Methodology** – Development or design of methodology; creation of models.
7. **Project administration** – Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution.
8. **Resources** – Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.
9. **Software** – Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.
10. **Supervision** – Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.
11. **Validation** – Verification of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.
12. **Visualization** – Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.
13. **Writing – original draft** – Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).
14. **Writing – review & editing** – Critical review, commentary or revision, including pre- or post-publication stages.

### Guidelines for Using CRediT

- All contributors should describe their input using CRediT roles (including those in Acknowledgements or listed as collaborators)
- The corresponding author should take responsibility for discussing and agreeing the assignment of CRediT roles
- All contributors should be given the opportunity to review and confirm assigned roles
- Some roles won't apply; omit roles not relevant to your output
- Individuals can have several roles
- Multiple contributors can share a specific role
- According to ICMJE criteria, all authors should be listed under one of the "Writing" categories

### Degree of Contribution

Where multiple individuals serve in the same role, the degree of contribution can optionally be specified as 'lead', 'equal', or 'supporting' in round brackets.

### Sample CRediT Format

```

Conceptualization: AB (lead), CD (equal)
Data curation: EF
