JMIR journals are top ranked academic, peer-reviewed journals. Authors are usually professors and academics, including PhD students, though we do publish perspective papers from patients and industry (including viewpoint papers and tutorials).

JMIR journals are open access and mainly funded by author contributions or departmental memberships. Unless your department is a member or you have institutional OA funding, you should have some sort of funding available, although some JMIR journals do not require any payment.

## Getting Started

1. Please study our Fee Schedule and the FAQ "Are there costs involved in publishing in JMIR journals?" or, if you don't have funding, our FAQ article "I don't have any grant money - how can I publish in JMIR?"
2. Read our instructions for authors carefully (Where are your instructions for authors?)
3. Submit a paper to any of our 20+ journals. Carefully decide which journal is the best for the current stage of your research.
4. Use our innovative knowledge translation and dissemination tools to promote your article (see e.g. What is TrendMD?)
