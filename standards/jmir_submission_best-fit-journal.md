Each journal homepage has an in-depth description of the types of articles it publishes.

## Internal Transfer System

Our manuscript management system is linked internally for all journals. Reviewers can suggest and academic editors can execute the transfer of an article to a more appropriate journal while the article is in review. Authors can also request a transfer themselves.

Please submit to whichever journal you feel is most appropriate for your paper in terms of scope and impact. Our editorial team will get in contact with you about a transfer if that becomes necessary at any point during the publishing process.

## Journal Selection Guidelines

Note that our top impact factor journals are usually more selective.

**More appropriate for sister journals (JMIR Formative Research, JMIR Research Protocols):**
- Formative research
- Preliminary findings
- Pilot studies
- Secondary data analysis
- Anything you think is preliminary work that helps you to get funding for subsequent phases of the research project
- Protocols/Proposals

**More appropriate for high-impact flagship journals (e.g., JMIR, JMIR mHealth):**
- Culminating, summative papers
