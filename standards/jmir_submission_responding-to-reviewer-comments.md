---

As an author you can use your author homepage to re-upload a revised manuscript based on comments made by the editor and reviewers. In addition to the revised manuscript, you must also provide a numbered point-by-point response to the reviewer's comments, as well as the title, abstract, and keywords for the manuscript.

**Important:** The manuscript must adhere to appropriate article type formats (e.g., word count, quantity of references, number of tables/figures, etc) throughout the peer review process and at the time of acceptance. If the manuscript exceeds the stated formatting above, then the APF for the applicable article type based on format will be applied.

## 1. Prepare Your Manuscript

Complete all of the following before submitting your revised manuscript:

- [ ] Revise the manuscript based on the comments made by all peer reviewers and the editor
- [ ] Prepare your manuscript and response offline using a text editor (such as Word)
- [ ] Do not use any text formatting, except for section headers and sub-headers
- [ ] Prepare a "point-by-point" response to all the editor and reviewer concerns/queries raised
- [ ] Upload a revised version with tracked changes (or highlighted sections of text where changes were made) as a supplementary file in "Other Files (Not for Publication)"
- [ ] Upload a clean copy of the manuscript, with all changes incorporated under "Revised MS"

Supplying all items above during the author revision stage facilitates the review process. Absence of any one of these items may delay the process.

## 2. Respond to Comments from the Reviewers and Editor

When submitting a revised manuscript, authors are required to submit a numbered "point-by-point" response to all the editor and reviewer comments.

While a response is required for each point, if the authors disagree with a reviewer comment, the authors may choose not to revise the manuscript in response to a specific comment. However, it is expected that the authors should provide an appropriate explanation of their disagreement with the reviewer and decision not to make revisions for that particular comment.

**Note:** The editor makes the final decision, not the reviewers.

### Format a Response

- Number your responses and make sure each response is associated with a specific reviewer
- For example, if you have 3 items mentioned by reviewer "A", mark your responses with A1, A2, and A3
- In each item, first quote the editor/reviewer, then write a response
- Begin responses with the text: "RESPONSE: ..."

### Unable to Address Reviewer Comments

If you are unable or unwilling to address any of the comments, please state the reason why in your point-by-point response (i.e., "Change was not made because..."). If the reviewer and author differ, the editor determines the next step and final decision.

## 3. Resubmit (Upload) a Revised Manuscript

To resubmit a revised manuscript:

1. Go to your author homepage
2. Select "awaiting author revision" in the Status column for the manuscript you are resubmitting
3. **(REQUIRED)** Upload all new supplementary material such as figures, appendices, etc. (only if supplementary files have changed)
4. **(REQUIRED)** Upload a revised version with tracked changes as a supplementary file in "Other Files (Not for Publication)"
5. **(REQUIRED)** In section 4. UPLOAD MANUSCRIPT, upload your clean (no tracked changes) revised manuscript
   - File must be either a .doc or .docx Word file
   - We cannot accept PDF, LaTeX, or PAGES files
6. **(REQUIRED)** Copy & paste your numbered point-by-point response to editorial and reviewer comments into the labeled box
7. Insert your title, abstract, and keywords based on editor feedback
8. Select Submit

After submitting your revision, verify receipt by:
- Looking for a confirmation email
- Verifying that the status has changed from "Awaiting revision" to "In review" on your author homepage

### Contact Editor with No Manuscript

It is possible to only send a message to the editor without uploading a new manuscript. Navigate to the page where you upload the manuscript and scroll down to "5. CONTACT EDITOR".

## 4. Transfer Options

Reviewers or editors may have suggested other JMIR Publications journals. Please indicate a ranking of these journals by order of preference, for a potential transfer if the paper is rejected from the current journal.

Note that the editor may reject the paper even if reviews are positive, if no journal preferences are entered, if the paper is out of scope or not strong enough for the journal it was submitted to.

## 5. Revision Deadline

The length of the deadline depends on the reviewer decision for the manuscript:

| Decision | Deadline |
|----------|----------|
| Decision B (minor revisions) | 1 week |
| Decision C (revisions required) | 3 weeks |
| Decision D (major revisions required) | 4 weeks |

From time to time, the deadlines may be shortened by the editor if a shorter timeline is more appropriate.

### Deadline Extension

If you believe you will be unable to make the deadline, or have missed the deadline, please contact us for a deadline extension.

### Missed Deadline

It is still technically possible to submit your revision after the deadline. If the deadline is missed and we don't hear from you at all, then we will remove the manuscript from the submission queue. In this case the manuscript won't be listed under "Active" anymore, and will have been moved to "Archive".

It is still possible to reinstate the manuscript as Active for a nominal Manuscript Reinstatement Fee.

## 6. Did Not Receive Editorial/Peer Review Email

If you did not receive an email with editorial/peer-review comments:

1. Check your spam filter for the email first
2. Review the editor/author correspondence online on the author homepage:
   - Navigate to your author homepage
   - Select the Status link for your paper
   - Select "Editor/Author Email Record" at the bottom of the review tab
