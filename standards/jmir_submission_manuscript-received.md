# Did you receive our manuscript or manuscript revision?

You should have received a confirmation email and the status you see on your author homepage should have changed from "Awaiting author revision - see Editor/Author Email log" to "In review".

**If you see that status change, it is not necessary to email the editor or support to ask again if we received it.**

## After Submission

If the status is still "Awaiting author revision", please closely follow the instructions on how to upload your revision.

See: As an author, how do I respond to reviewer comments and upload a revised manuscript (resubmission/revision of a manuscript)?
