---

You will receive an automated submission confirmation after you submitted a manuscript.

## If You Didn't Receive Confirmation

If you did not get any confirmation email:

1. **Check your spamfilter:** Allow JMIR mails to get through, otherwise you will miss subsequent decision emails and other communications
2. **Check the status online:** See "What is the status of my submission?"

## Incomplete Submissions

If the submission is marked as incomplete, then the editor cannot see the submission and we have not "received" it.

## Revised Manuscripts

If you submitted a revision, you now also get a confirmation email. See: We have submitted a revised manuscript. However, we have not received a confirmation that the manuscript was received
