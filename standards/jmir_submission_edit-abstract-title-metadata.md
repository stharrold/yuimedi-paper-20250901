# How do I edit the abstract/title in the metadata form on revision or before publication?

---

You must edit the abstract (and title, if necessary) not only in the Word document, but also in the online metadata form, when you submit your revision or when you upload your final manuscript version.

See: How do I edit/correct/enter article metadata before publication?

## Important for PubMed Now! Users

This is particularly important if you chose the PubMed Now! option, because the abstract and title of the PubMed submission will be generated from the metadata form, not from what is in the manuscript!

## Reminders

- **For protocols or proposals:** A results section in the abstract is necessary, even if there are no results yet
- **For titles:** Please remember to mention the study design (and "Protocol of a ... Study" for protocols) in the title
