## Key Scripts

### create_worktree.py

**Purpose:** Create isolated worktree for feature/release/hotfix development with automatic TODO file creation

**When to use:** Phase 2 (Implementation) - after BMAD planning (optional), before SpecKit

**Invocation:**
```bash
# Feature worktree from contrib branch
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_worktree.py \
  feature <slug> contrib/<gh-user>

# Release worktree from develop
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_worktree.py \
  release <version> develop

# Hotfix worktree from main
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_worktree.py \
  hotfix <slug> main
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Feature: Create feature/20251104T143000Z_auth-system from contrib/stharrold
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_worktree.py \
  feature auth-system contrib/stharrold

# Release: Create release/v1.6.0 from develop
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_worktree.py \
  release v1.6.0 develop

# Hotfix: Create hotfix/20251104T150000Z_security-patch from main
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_worktree.py \
  hotfix security-patch main
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates workflow type (feature/release/hotfix) and slug format
2. Generates timestamp in compact ISO8601 format (YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ)
3. Creates branch: `<type>/<timestamp>_<slug>` or `release/<version>`
4. Creates worktree directory: `../german_<type>_<slug>/`
5. Creates TODO file: `TODO_<type>_<timestamp>_<slug>.md` in **main repo**
6. Initializes TODO with YAML frontmatter and basic structure
7. Prints worktree path and instructions

**Key features:**
- Timestamp format avoids shell escaping issues (no colons/hyphens)
- TODO file stored in main repo (not worktree) for persistence
- Validates base branch exists
- Creates compliant directory structure
- Error handling with cleanup on failure

---

### cleanup_feature.py

**Purpose:** Atomically archive TODO and cleanup feature worktree in correct order: Archive TODO → Delete worktree → Delete branches

**When to use:** Phase 4 (Integration) - after PR merged to contrib

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This script prevents orphaned TODO files by enforcing proper cleanup ordering. Manual cleanup is error-prone and NOT recommended.

**Invocation:**
```bash
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/cleanup_feature.py \
  <slug> \
  --summary "Completion summary" \
  --version "X.Y.Z"
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Cleanup feature
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/cleanup_feature.py \
  auth-system \
  --summary "Implemented user authentication with JWT tokens" \
  --version "1.5.0"

# Cleanup issue fix
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/cleanup_feature.py \
  issue-243-todo-status \
  --summary "Updated TODO file to reflect completion" \
  --version "1.13.0"

# Cleanup with project-specific worktree pattern
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/cleanup_feature.py \
  auth-system \
  --summary "Implemented user authentication" \
  --version "1.5.0" \
  --project-name german
```

**What it does:**
1. **Finds TODO file:** Searches for `TODO_feature_*_{slug}.md` in main repo
2. **Finds worktree:** Searches for `../feature_{slug}/` or `../{project}_feature_{slug}/`
3. **Finds branch:** Searches for `feature/*_{slug}` branch
4. **Archives TODO:** Calls `workflow_archiver.py` (MUST succeed before proceeding)
5. **Deletes worktree:** Removes worktree directory (only if archive succeeded)
6. **Deletes branches:** Removes local and remote branches (only if worktree deletion succeeded)

**Key features:**
- **Atomic operation:** Either everything succeeds or nothing changes (safe to retry)
- **Correct ordering:** Cannot delete worktree without archiving TODO first
- **Error handling:** If TODO archive fails, worktree/branches NOT deleted (safe state)
- **Single command:** Replaces 4 separate manual commands
- **Clear feedback:** Emojis and progress indicators for each step

**Why atomic cleanup:**
- Prevents orphaned TODO files (main repo cleanup issue)
- Prevents confusion about workflow state
- Safe rollback on errors (idempotent)
- Single source of truth for cleanup logic

**Failure modes:**
- **TODO not found:** Script fails immediately, nothing deleted
- **Archive fails:** Script exits, worktree/branches preserved (safe to retry)
- **Worktree deletion fails:** TODO archived, but worktree remains (manual cleanup instructions provided)
- **Branch deletion fails:** TODO archived, worktree deleted, but branches remain (manual cleanup instructions provided)

---

### daily_rebase.py

**Purpose:** Rebase contrib branch onto develop to stay current with integration branch

**When to use:** Daily maintenance, before starting new work, before creating PR

**Invocation:**
```bash
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/daily_rebase.py \
  contrib/<gh-user>
```

**Example:**
```bash
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/daily_rebase.py \
  contrib/stharrold
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates branch starts with `contrib/`
2. Checks for uncommitted changes (fails if dirty)
3. Checks out contrib branch
4. Fetches from origin
5. Rebases onto origin/develop
6. Force pushes with `--force-with-lease` (safe force push)

**Key features:**
- Safe force push: `--force-with-lease` prevents overwriting others' work
- Validates clean working tree before rebase
- Comprehensive error handling
- Target branch: `origin/develop` (documented rationale)

---

### semantic_version.py

**Purpose:** Calculate semantic version automatically based on code changes

**When to use:** Phase 3 (Quality Gates) - after implementation, before PR

**Invocation:**
```bash
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/semantic_version.py \
  <base-branch> <current-version>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# From feature branch, compare to develop, current version v1.5.0
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/semantic_version.py \
  develop v1.5.0

# Output: 1.6.0 (if new features detected)
```

**What it does:**
1. Compares changed files between current branch and base branch
2. Analyzes changes using semver rules:
   - **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes (API changes, removed features)
   - **MINOR** (1.X.0): New features (new files in src/, new endpoints)
   - **PATCH** (1.5.X): Bug fixes, refactoring, docs, tests
3. Calculates next version from current version + change type
4. Outputs new version (e.g., `1.6.0`)

**Key features:**
- Automatic version calculation (no manual decisions)
- File-based change analysis
- Semantic versioning compliance
- Used by quality-enforcer to update TODO frontmatter

---

### create_release.py

**Purpose:** Create release branch from develop for final QA and release preparation

**When to use:** Phase 5 (Release) - when develop is ready for production

**Invocation:**
```bash
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_release.py \
  <version> <base-branch>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Create release/v1.6.0 from develop
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_release.py \
  v1.6.0 develop
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates version format (vX.Y.Z)
2. Creates branch: `release/<version>` from base branch
3. Creates TODO file: `TODO_release_<timestamp>_<version-slug>.md`
4. Initializes TODO with YAML frontmatter
5. Prints instructions for next steps

**Key features:**
- Version format validation (semantic versioning)
- TODO file tracking for release workflow
- Prevents duplicate release branches

---

### tag_release.py

**Purpose:** Tag release on main branch after PR merge

**When to use:** Phase 5 (Release) - after merging release PR to main

**Invocation:**
```bash
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/tag_release.py \
  <version> <branch>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Tag v1.6.0 on main branch
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/tag_release.py \
  v1.6.0 main
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates version format (vX.Y.Z)
2. Checks out specified branch (usually main)
3. Creates annotated git tag: `<version>`
4. Pushes tag to origin
5. Updates CHANGELOG.md (if exists)

**Key features:**
- Annotated tags (includes message)
- Version validation
- Automatic CHANGELOG updates

---

### backmerge_release.py

**Purpose:** Back-merge release changes to develop after tagging

**When to use:** Phase 5 (Release) - after tagging release on main

**Invocation:**
```bash
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/backmerge_release.py \
  <version> <target-branch>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Merge release/v1.6.0 back to develop
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/backmerge_release.py \
  v1.6.0 develop
```

**What it does:**
1. Checks out target branch (develop)
2. Merges release branch
3. Resolves conflicts if any (manual intervention required)
4. Pushes to origin

**Key features:**
- Keeps develop in sync with production
- Handles merge conflicts gracefully
- Validates branches exist

---

### cleanup_release.py

**Purpose:** Delete release branch after successful completion

**When to use:** Phase 5 (Release) - after back-merge completes

**Invocation:**
```bash
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/cleanup_release.py \
  <version>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Delete release/v1.6.0 locally and remotely
python .claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/cleanup_release.py \
  v1.6.0
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates release is tagged and merged
2. Deletes local branch: `release/<version>`
3. Deletes remote branch: `origin/release/<version>`
4. Archives TODO file to ARCHIVED/

**Key features:**
- Safety checks (tag must exist, branch must be merged)

## Usage by Claude Code

### Phase 2: Create Feature Worktree

**Context:** User wants to start implementing a feature

**User says:**
- "Create feature worktree for auth system"
- "Start working on new feature"
- "Begin implementation"

**Claude Code should:**
```python
import subprocess

# Call create_worktree.py
result = subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_worktree.py',
    'feature',
    'auth-system',  # slug
    'contrib/stharrold'  # base branch
], check=True)

# After worktree created, move to SpecKit (Phase 2.3)
```

---

### Daily Maintenance: Rebase Contrib

**Context:** User starts new session or before creating PR

**User says:**
- "Rebase my branch"
- "Update contrib branch"
- "Sync with develop"

**Claude Code should:**
```python
import subprocess

# Call daily_rebase.py
result = subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/daily_rebase.py',
    'contrib/stharrold'
], check=True)
```

---

### Phase 3: Calculate Version

**Context:** Implementation complete, need semantic version for PR

**User says:**
- "What version should this be?"
- "Calculate semantic version"
- "Run quality gates"

**Claude Code should:**
```python
import subprocess

# Call semantic_version.py
result = subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/semantic_version.py',
    'develop',  # base branch
    'v1.5.0'    # current version
], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

new_version = result.stdout.strip()  # e.g., "1.6.0"

# Use new_version in TODO file, PR title, etc.
```

---

### Phase 4: Handle PR Feedback via Work-Items

**Context:** PR reviewed, has unresolved conversations requiring follow-up work

**User says:**
- "Generate work-items from PR feedback"
- "Create issues for PR #94 conversations"
- "Extract unresolved PR comments"

**Claude Code should:**
```python
import subprocess

# Call generate_work_items_from_pr.py
result = subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/generate_work_items_from_pr.py',
    '94'  # PR number
], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

# Script outputs work-item URLs and slugs
# Example output:
# ✓ Found 3 unresolved conversations
# ✓ Created work-item: pr-94-issue-1 (https://github.com/user/repo/issues/123)
# ✓ Created work-item: pr-94-issue-2 (https://github.com/user/repo/issues/124)
# ✓ Created work-item: pr-94-issue-3 (https://github.com/user/repo/issues/125)

# For each work-item, create feature worktree
work_items = ['pr-94-issue-1', 'pr-94-issue-2', 'pr-94-issue-3']
for slug in work_items:
    # User approves PR in web portal first
    # Then create worktree for each work-item
    subprocess.run([
        'python',
        '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_worktree.py',
        'feature',
        slug,
        'contrib/stharrold'
    ], check=True)
```

**Complete PR Feedback Workflow:**
```python
import subprocess

# Step 1: Feature branch merged to contrib via PR
# (User merges PR #94 in GitHub/Azure DevOps UI)

# Step 2: Generate work-items from unresolved conversations
result = subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/generate_work_items_from_pr.py',
    '94'
], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

# Step 3: For first work-item, create feature worktree
subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_worktree.py',
    'feature',
    'pr-94-issue-1',
    'contrib/stharrold'
], check=True)

# Step 4: Implement fix in worktree
# (SpecKit, implementation, quality gates)

# Step 5: Create PR: feature/YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ_pr-94-issue-1 → contrib/stharrold
# Step 6: User merges PR in web portal
# Step 7: Repeat steps 3-6 for remaining work-items

# Step 8: After all work-items resolved, approve original PR in web portal
```

**Integration with GitHub:**
```python
import subprocess
import json

# For GitHub repositories
result = subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/generate_work_items_from_pr.py',
    '94'
], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

# Creates GitHub issues with:
# - Label: "pr-feedback"
# - Label: "pr-94"
# - Title: "PR #94 feedback: {conversation summary}"
# - Body: Full conversation with file/line context
# - Links to original PR

# Check created issues
issues = subprocess.run([
    'gh', 'issue', 'list',
    '--label', 'pr-94',
    '--json', 'number,title,url'
], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

issue_list = json.loads(issues.stdout)
# [{'number': 123, 'title': 'PR #94 feedback: ...', 'url': '...'}, ...]
```

**Integration with Azure DevOps:**
```python
import subprocess
import json

# For Azure DevOps repositories
result = subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/generate_work_items_from_pr.py',
    '94'
], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

# Creates Azure DevOps tasks with:
# - Type: Task
# - Tags: "pr-feedback", "pr-94"
# - Title: "PR #94 feedback: {thread subject}"
# - Description: Full thread content with file context
# - Relations: Links to PR URL

# Check created work-items
work_items = subprocess.run([
    'az', 'boards', 'work-item', 'list',
    '--query', "[?fields.'System.Tags' contains 'pr-94']",
    '--output', 'json'
], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

item_list = json.loads(work_items.stdout)
# [{'id': 456, 'fields': {'System.Title': 'PR #94 feedback: ...'}, ...}, ...]
```

---

### Phase 5: Release Workflow

**Context:** Develop ready for production release

**User says:**
- "Create release"
- "Prepare v1.6.0 for production"
- "Start release process"

**Claude Code should execute sequence:**
```python
import subprocess

# Step 1: Create release branch
subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/create_release.py',
    'v1.6.0',
    'develop'
], check=True)

# Step 2: User performs QA, updates docs in release branch

# Step 3: User creates PR (release/v1.6.0 → main) and merges in GitHub UI

# Step 4: Tag release on main
subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/tag_release.py',
    'v1.6.0',
    'main'
], check=True)

# Step 5: Back-merge to develop
subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/backmerge_release.py',
    'v1.6.0',
    'develop'
], check=True)

# Step 6: Cleanup release branch
subprocess.run([
    'python',
    '.claude/skills/git-workflow-manager/scripts/cleanup_release.py',
    'v1.6.0'
], check=True)
```

**workflow-orchestrator:**
- Orchestrator calls create_worktree.py at Phase 2 start
- Orchestrator calls semantic_version.py at Phase 3
- Orchestrator calls daily_rebase.py as needed

**speckit-author:**
- SpecKit runs in worktrees created by create_worktree.py
- SpecKit reads TODO file created by create_worktree.py

**quality-enforcer:**
- Quality enforcer calls semantic_version.py to calculate version
- Updates TODO frontmatter with semantic_version result

**workflow-utilities:**
- Uses workflow_archiver.py to archive TODO files
- Uses vcs abstraction for PR creation (gh/az cli)

**bmad-planner:**
- BMAD planning happens before create_worktree.py
- Worktree references ../planning/<slug>/ for context

---

## Git-Flow + GitHub-Flow Hybrid

This skill implements a hybrid workflow:

**Git-Flow elements:**
- Long-lived branches: main, develop, contrib/<user>
- Feature branches from contrib
- Release branches from develop
- Hotfix branches from main

**GitHub-Flow elements:**
- PRs for all merges
- Short-lived feature branches
- Continuous integration via develop
- Worktree isolation

**Worktree pattern:**
- Feature work happens in isolated worktrees
- TODO files stored in main repo (persistent)
- Clean separation between main repo and worktrees

---

## Constants and Rationale

**TIMESTAMP_FORMAT:** `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` (compact ISO8601)
- **Rationale:** No colons/hyphens avoids shell escaping issues. Remains intact when branch names are parsed by underscores.

**VALID_WORKFLOW_TYPES:** `['feature', 'release', 'hotfix']`
- **Rationale:** Supports all workflow phases with clear naming

**TARGET_BRANCH:** `origin/develop`
- **Rationale:** Integration branch for all contributions. All contrib branches rebase onto develop.

**Force push safety:** `--force-with-lease`
- **Rationale:** Only force-pushes if remote hasn't changed since last fetch. Prevents accidental overwrites.
