### 🗂️ **Project Structure Validation**
- [ ] **File organization** - Confirm all research documents are properly integrated
- [ ] **Documentation consistency** - Ensure README.md, CLAUDE.md, and scripts docs align
- [ ] **Version control readiness** - Review what files should be committed vs. ignored

## Decisions Needed

### 📊 **Publication Strategy**
- [ ] **Target journal selection** - Choose from:
  - Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA) - high impact
  - Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) - open access
  - International Journal of Medical Informatics - European focus
  - Healthcare Management Review - business focus

- [ ] **Author attribution strategy** - Determine:
  - Individual vs. team attribution
  - Institutional affiliation representation
  - Corresponding author designation

### 🎯 **Research Direction**
- [ ] **Empirical validation planning** - Consider conducting actual implementation study
- [ ] **Conference presentation strategy** - HIMSS, AMIA, or healthcare IT conferences
- [ ] **Industry collaboration** - Partnerships with healthcare organizations for validation

### 🛠️ **Development Environment**
- [ ] **Team environment consistency** - Standardize UV setup across collaborators
- [ ] **CI/CD integration** - Consider GitHub Actions for automated PDF generation
- [ ] **Pre-commit hooks** - Implement code quality checks (black, flake8, mypy)

## Environment Setup

### ✅ **Completed Setup**
- [x] UV environment created with Python 3.8.6
- [x] Project installed in development mode with dev dependencies
- [x] Bidirectional GitHub sync operational
- [x] Scripts documentation comprehensive and current

### 🔧 **Optional Enhancements**
- [ ] **Install Eisvogel template** for professional PDF formatting:
  ```bash
  wget https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template/releases/latest/download/eisvogel.latex
  mkdir -p ~/.pandoc/templates
  mv eisvogel.latex ~/.pandoc/templates/
  ```
- [ ] **Install pandoc filters** for enhanced document generation:
  ```bash
  npm install -g mermaid-filter  # For Mermaid diagram rendering
  ```
- [ ] **Setup pre-commit hooks** for code quality:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pre-commit install
  ```

### 📁 **Branch and Version Control**
- [ ] **Decide on main branch merge** - Current work on `work/samuel.harrold` branch
- [ ] **Create release tag** - Consider v1.0 for completed research paper
- [ ] **Repository cleanup** - Confirm all new files should be committed
