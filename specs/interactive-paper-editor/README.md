# Interactive Paper Editor

**GitHub Issue:** #376

## Overview

Interactive editing workflow for `paper.md` - the primary research paper deliverable.

## Documents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `spec.md` | Technical specification |
| `plan.md` | Implementation plan with task breakdown |
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI context for Claude Code |

## Quick Start

This is a documentation workflow, not a code feature. To start an editing session:

1. Load paper.md and understand current structure
2. Make iterative edits based on user requests
3. Run validation: `./validate_documentation.sh`
4. Commit changes when validation passes
