Dear Springer Nature Author Services Team,

I am requesting a visual abstract and video byte for my review article, "Healthcare Analytics Challenges: A Three-Pillar Framework Connecting Analytics Maturity, Workforce Agility, and Technical Enablement"

The goal is to illustrate the "Compounding Crisis" where three distinct challenges reinforce one another to cause institutional memory loss.

While I would like to propose the following elements for the visual abstract and video byte, I leave all creative decisions to your expert team.

Pillar 1: Analytics Maturity (The Observation): Only 39 organizations globally have achieved HIMSS AMAM Stage 6-7. Contrast this with the majority of organizations remaining at Stages 0-3 with limited predictive capabilities.

Pillar 2: Workforce Agility (The Cause): The systemic instabilities include that 53% of healthcare CIOs have a tenure of less than three years and 79% of healthcare organizations report shortages in information and digital health roles. A visual metaphor for "Institutional Memory Loss" can convey expertise leaving the organization.

Pillar 3: Technical Enablement (The Root Mechanism): The "Validated Query Cycle" can be a solution. Natural language interfaces lead to 63% increase in self-service adoption and bridge the gap between domain expertise (clinicians) and technical SQL databases.

A circular "feedback loop" connects these pillars: low maturity accelerates turnover, which in turn degrades the knowledge needed to advance analytics maturity.

As ideas for the video byte storyboard (60-90 Seconds):

Scene 1 (The Problem): Visuals of fragmented data and "Institutional Memory Loss".
Narration conveys that healthcare organizations face a compounding crisis that threatens data-driven transformation.

Scene 2 (The Framework): Introduce the three pillars: Analytics Maturity, Workforce Agility, and Technical Enablement.
Narration conveys that analytics degradation is driven by a workforce crisis where high turnover erases institutional knowledge. This is perpetuated by technical barriers that prevent us from capturing expertise before it is lost.

Scene 3 (The Solution): Animation of the 6-step "Validated Query Cycle": Query, Generation, Validation, Storage, Retrieval, and Persistence.
Narration conveys that by implementing a "Governance Forcing Function," organizations can embed expertise into systems rather than individuals. This reduces data retrieval time by 37% and allows knowledge to survive staff turnover.

Scene 4 (Conclusion): The three-pillar assessment rubric.
Narration conveys this framework provides a lens for self-assessment and strategic intervention to break the cycle of degradation.

Thank you for helping bring this research to life.
