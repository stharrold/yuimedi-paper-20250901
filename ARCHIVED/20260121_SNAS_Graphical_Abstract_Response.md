1. What is your intended audience?
An educated general audience.

2. Please provide a 1- to 2-sentence summary of the information you'd like us to highlight.
This research introduces a three-pillar framework connecting analytics maturity, workforce agility, and technical enablement to explain the 'compounding crisis' blocking healthcare data transformation. It illustrates how technologies like conversational AI can capture institutional memory and democratize data access to significantly improve clinical outcomes and operational efficiency.

3. Additional Assets
Attached are diagrams (SVG, PNG) and captions (TXT) for "Healthcare Analytics Architecture" and "Validated Query Cycle."

I am happy to provide any additional information if needed.

Best regards,
