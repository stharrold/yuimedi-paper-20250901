# Quality Gates

## Project: YuiQuery Healthcare Analytics Whitepapers

Quality gates ensure each paper meets minimum standards before proceeding to next phase.

## Gate 1: Literature Validation (Paper 1)
- **Criteria**: Minimum 10 validated sources from healthcare institutions
- **TRL Level**: 3 (NASA Technology Readiness Level)
- **Decision Maker**: YLT designated member
- **Deadline**: 2025-09-25
- **Evidence Required**:
  - Systematic review protocol documented
  - PRISMA flow diagram completed
  - Gap analysis validates YuiQuery need
  - Citations from peer-reviewed journals
- **Reference**: https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/458490main_trl_definitions.pdf

## Gate 2: Algorithm Accuracy (Paper 2)
- **Criteria**: 85% accuracy minimum in schema inference
- **Reference**: https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12808 (ML benchmarks in healthcare)
- **Testing**: Against synthetic dataset (Synthea) and institutional data
- **Deadline**: 2025-12-10
- **Metrics Required**:
  - Precision/Recall scores documented
  - F1 score > 0.80
  - Performance on degraded data demonstrated
  - Comparison to manual methods (50% time reduction)
- **Decision Maker**: Technical review committee

## Gate 3: Interoperability (Paper 3)
- **Criteria**: 3+ healthcare system mappings demonstrated
- **Standard**: FHIR R4 compliance
- **Systems**: Epic, CMS quality models, OMOP CDM
- **Deadline**: 2026-03-01
- **Deliverables**:
  - JSON-LD mapping schemas
  - Query portability demonstrated
  - Integration time metrics (70% reduction target)
  - Validation from standards expert
- **Reference**: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/

## Stage-Gate Process

### Pre-Gate Reviews
- Internal review 1 week before gate
- SME feedback incorporated
- Risk assessment updated
- Budget vs actual reviewed

### Gate Decision Options
1. **GO**: Proceed to next phase
2. **CONDITIONAL GO**: Proceed with specific corrections
3. **HOLD**: Additional work required
4. **KILL**: Stop project (only if fundamental flaws)

### Documentation Requirements
Each gate requires:
- Executive summary (1 page)
- Technical validation report
- Risk update
- Resource assessment
- Next phase plan

## Success Metrics Tracking

| Paper | Gate | Target | Actual | Status | Date |
|-------|------|--------|--------|--------|------|
| 1 | Literature | 10 sources | TBD | Pending | 2025-09-25 |
| 2 | Algorithm | 85% accuracy | TBD | Pending | 2025-12-10 |
| 3 | Interop | 3 systems | TBD | Pending | 2026-03-01 |

## Escalation Process
If gate criteria not met:
1. Document specific gaps
2. Propose remediation plan with timeline
3. YLT review within 48 hours
4. Decision on path forward
